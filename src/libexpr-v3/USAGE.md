# v3 evaluator — usage

The v3 evaluator is a clean-room replacement for the existing nix
tree-walker / v2 bytecode VM, with a single bytecode pipeline (no
runtime fallback to the tree-walker), 16-byte tagged Values, FAM
upvalues for Closures, and a re-entrant dispatcher.

This file documents what works **today** so we don't have to guess.
Update it as coverage grows.

## Building

```bash
# from src/libexpr-v3
nix develop -c make help     # show all targets
nix develop -c make check    # build + run hand-built IR smoke tests
nix develop -c make check-debug  # same with ASan + UBSan

# Top-level meson build (also produces v3-eval CLI)
nix develop -c ninja -C build src/libexpr-v3/v3-eval
nix develop -c ninja -C build src/libexpr-v3/v3-smoke
./build/src/libexpr-v3/v3-eval '<expression>'
```

## v3-eval CLI

`v3-eval EXPR` parses EXPR through nix's parser, runs `bindVars`,
lowers to v3 IR, compiles to bytecode, and runs through the v3 VM.

Exits with status 0 on success; prints the resulting value on stdout.
On unsupported AST shapes or runtime errors, prints `v3-eval error: …`
on stderr and exits 1.

### IR dump flags (IR-CHECK MVP, 2026-05-18)

For LLVM-FileCheck-style testing of the optimizer pipeline:

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `--emit-ir` | Dump POST-optimisation IR to stdout and exit (suppresses normal eval). |
| `--emit-ir-raw` | Dump PRE-optimisation IR (after lower, before optimise). |
| `--no-opt` | When combined with `--emit-ir`, skip the optimise pass — equivalent to `--emit-ir-raw` but available for explicit A/B comparison. |
| `--file PATH` | Read the Nix expression from PATH (mutually exclusive with `--expr`).  Used by IR-CHECK fixtures as `--file %s`. |

Example session:

```
$ v3-eval --expr '(x: x * 2) 21' --emit-ir-raw
; module n_funcs=2 n_blocks=3 nextVar=11
; func f0 entry=B1 nUp=0
B1:
  v7 = Lambda f1 freeVars=[]
  v8 = LitInt 21
  v9 = App v7 v8
  ...

$ v3-eval --expr '(x: x * 2) 21' --emit-ir
; module n_funcs=2 n_blocks=3 nextVar=16
; func f0 entry=B1 nUp=0
B1:
  v15 = LitInt 42
  return v15
  ...
```

The output format is stable and byte-deterministic across runs
(guarded by `test/run-ir-dump-determinism.sh`).

### v3-check CLI (LLVM-FileCheck subset)

`v3-check MATCH-FILE [--check-prefix=PREFIX]` reads stdin as the
"actual" output, parses CHECK directives from MATCH-FILE (`.nix`
files using `#` line-comments), and exits 0 on PASS / non-zero with
diagnostic on FAIL.  Supported:

- `# CHECK: pat` — forward substring search.
- `# CHECK-NOT: pat` — forbid `pat` before next positive match.
- `# CHECK-LABEL: pat` — strong anchor; resets cursor.
- `# CHECK-NEXT: pat` — match the line immediately after the prior positive.
- `{{regex}}` — embedded regex within an otherwise-literal pattern.
- `--check-prefix=FOO` — substitute "CHECK" for "FOO" (multi-RUN).

### IR-CHECK fixtures

`test/ir-fixtures/*.nix` are LLVM-`lit`-style fixtures.  Each file
contains:

1. One or more `# RUN: ...` shell-command lines (the runner extracts
   these; `%s` is substituted with the fixture path).
2. A Nix expression body (parsed by `v3-eval --file %s`).
3. `# CHECK:` directives that `v3-check` asserts against the
   `v3-eval` IR dump.

Run all fixtures: `nix develop -c bash src/libexpr-v3/test/run-ir-checks.sh` (or via meson: `meson test -C build v3-ir-checks`).

See `test/ir-fixtures/README.md` for the fixture-authoring guide.

## NIX_USE_V3 cutover

Setting `NIX_USE_V3=1` routes the regular `nix` CLI's evaluator
through v3:

    NIX_USE_V3=1 ./build/src/nix/nix eval --expr '1 + 2'    # 3
    NIX_USE_V3=1 ./build/src/nix/nix eval --expr 'fib 30 ...'

The hook is wired in via an explicit `nix::v3::installEvalHook()`
call from `nix::mainWrapped`.  This serves two purposes: it
populates the function pointer that `EvalState::eval` consults, and
it provides a strong symbol reference so macOS's
`-dead_strip_dylibs` can't remove libnixexprv3 from the binary.

Real-world behaviour (2026-05-05 numbers, hyperfine, aarch64-darwin):

  - **fib30**: v3 cutover ~0.30 s user, ~5% faster than tree-walker.
  - **`(import nixpkgs {}).hello.name`** (nixpkgs cold-path):
    TW ~366 ms, v3 ~378 ms (~3% slower).  Within noise.
  - **cardano-node real-flake `.packages…cardano-node.name`** (deep
    fix-point):  TW ~3.7 s user, v3 ~3.9 s user (~5% slower).  Phase E
    closes a 12% gap that v3 default would otherwise have.
  - **Memory** (`/usr/bin/time -l`):  v3 +36 MB on cardano-node vs TW
    (~4% larger RSS).  Memory wins are pending under #417 / #418.

Opt-in features (off by default unless noted):

  - `NIX_V3_NO_INVERT_EVAL=1`:  disables Phase E (`invert eval entry`).
    Phase E is **default-on** -- it lets v3 own closure-producing
    top-level Exprs and bridges Tag::Closure results back via
    `__v3_call_bridge_1`.  Three sub-lifts (`NIX_V3_NO_LIFT_LAMBDA` /
    `NIX_V3_NO_LIFT_ATTRSLIST` / `NIX_V3_NO_LIFT_WRC`) toggle each
    lift independently for bisection.  The IR-level `LIFT_IRWPC` is
    OPT-IN (`NIX_V3_LIFT_IRWPC=1`) -- combining it with WRC trips an
    infinite-recursion bug on nixpkgs-lib `eachSystem`.
  - `NIX_V3_CALL_FORMALS=1`:  Phase C -- formals-lambdas in the call
    hook with shallow-attrs-bridge.  Default off because it costs
    bridge overhead on cardano-node-class workloads.
  - `NIX_V3_ON_DEMAND_ROOT=1`:  Phase B / OD -- compile-on-call-miss
    via lambda→root map.  Has known correctness bug on cardano-node-
    style fix-point overlays (#455 -- env-shape mismatch in
    `lib/fixed-points.nix:327`'s `prev // overlay final prev`).
    Pair with `NIX_V3_ON_DEMAND_ROOT_UNSAFE=1` to lift the SAFE-mode
    nUpvalues=0 gate.
  - `NIX_V3_PARSE_PRECOMPILE=1`:  precompile every parsed file at
    parse time.  Same correctness gate as OD on cardano-node.
  - `NIX_V3_DISK_CACHE=1`:  SQLite-backed CU cache.  Schema v3 with
    opcode-table fingerprint (caches invalidate on opcode renumbering).
  - `NIX_V3_AOT_BUILD_MODE=<path>`:  manifest-recorder mode.  Every
    successful disk_cache insert (CompilationUnits + EvalResults)
    appends `<unix_ts> <table> <key_hex> <blob_size>` to the manifest
    file.  Use during a cold eval to capture the working set; feed
    the manifest into `bench/build-aot-cache.py` to produce a flat
    file for AOT distribution.  See [`lode/AOT_PHASE1_DAY1-3_2026-05-26.md`].
  - `NIX_V3_AOT_CACHE_FILE=<path>`:  load a pre-built AOT cache file
    via `mmap(MAP_PRIVATE|PROT_READ)`.  Acts as L3 fast-path in
    `disk_cache::lookup` (consulted BEFORE SQLite L2).  Default
    behaviour unchanged when unset.  Day 13-15 measurement on HNE
    warm: ~5 % wall improvement (1.03-1.07× faster than SQLite).
    See [`lode/AOT_PHASE1_VERDICT_2026-05-27.md`] for SHIP verdict.
  - `NIX_V3_AOT_QUIET=1`:  suppress the AOT init banner; useful for
    benchmark scripts that should produce clean output.
  - `NIX_V3_BRIDGE1_DEPTH=N`:  cap nested `__v3_call_bridge_1` calls.
    Default 8.  Bounds pthread-stack burn on deep overlay chains.
  - `NIX_V3_BRIDGE_TIMING=1`:  enable per-bridge wall-time accumulation
    in the #458 step B telemetry (always-on counts, opt-in timings).
    Adds ~10-30 ns per bridge call (`steady_clock::now()`); the
    per-direction nsTotal lets you see e.g. that v3->tw consumed
    250 ms over 5000 calls = 50 us avg.  The dump fires at exit
    when any of NIX_V3_PRIMOP_DUMP / NIX_VM_STATS / V3_TIMING is set.
    Counters (without timings) print regardless.
  - `NIX_V3_NO_BRIDGE1_SHORTCIRCUIT=1`:  disable the #458 step 2
    bridge1 short-circuit.  Default ON: when TW's `callFunction`
    encounters `mkPrimOpApp(__v3_call_bridge_1, handle)`, route
    directly via v3's `callClosure`, bypassing TW's primop dispatch
    (which eagerly forces args -- the cardano-node #455 cycle source).
    Disable for A/B perf testing.
  - `NIX_V3_PRIMOP_DUMP=1`:  print per-primop call counts at exit
    (plus TW->v3 bridge primop counts: `__v3_call_bridge_1`,
    `__v3_force_attr`, `__v3_force_list_elem`).
  - `NIX_VM_STATS=1` / `V3_TIMING=1`:  hook stats / lower-compile-run
    breakdown at exit.
  - `NIX_V3_INTRINSIC_DISPATCH=1`:  #495 native fix-point intrinsic
    dispatch.  Pattern-matched lambda bodies (canonical `lib.fix`
    shape) bypass the bytecode call path and run a v3-native impl
    that knot-ties via Tag::Slot.  Recognition is always on
    (zero-cost when this flag is unset); only the dispatch is opt-in.
    Counter `intrinsic Fix: native dispatch calls=N` reported under
    `NIX_VM_STATS=1`.  See also `NIX_V3_SELF_DOT_MAX_LEVEL`.
  - `NIX_V3_SELF_DOT_MAX_LEVEL=N`:  #495 follow-on -- targeted
    thunkify of `inherit (self.X) Y` from-exprs walks up to N scope
    levels to find a Lambda scope (default 0 = only the immediately
    enclosing `self:` lambda).  Set to 2 to catch the nixpkgs
    `lib.fix` shape (where `self` sits behind an intermediate `let`
    inside `makeExtensible'`).  Higher values currently regress
    nixpkgs hello.name with an `OP_ATTRS_SELECT: attribute not found`
    upvalue-capture bug -- safe levels are 0 (default) and 2 (only
    when the user knows they're evaluating fix-point-heavy code,
    typically alongside `NIX_V3_INTRINSIC_DISPATCH=1`).
  - `NIX_V3_NO_INHERIT_FROM_THUNK=1`:  disable all inherit-from
    thunkification (force eager from-expr lowering).  For perf
    measurement / debugging only; introduces the `inherit (self.X) Y`
    infinite recursion bug.
  - `NIX_V3_INHERIT_FROM_THUNK_ALL=1`:  thunkify every inherit-from
    from-expr unconditionally.  Equivalent to the
    `NIX_V3_LAMBDA_SKIP=1` blanket gate; regresses nixpkgs hello.name
    same as the broader self-dot heuristic.  Debugging only.

How parity was reached:

  - **Static short-circuits** route Expr kinds where v3's
    lower+compile+run cycle is net-negative versus tree-walker
    directly to tree-walker.  Currently short-circuited:
      * Literals (Int / Float / String / Path / Bool-singleton)
      * Var, Pos
      * Lambda (would return Closure → bridge can't hand back)
      * Attrs, List (file-toplevel; tree-walker constructs lazy
        thunks faster than v3's eager eval + recursive bridge)
  - **`willReturnClosure` predicate** walks the AST through Let /
    With / Assert / If-with-both-Lambda-branches and short-circuits
    when the result is statically a closure.

Per-phase profile (V3_TIMING=1, hello.name):

    v3 hook timing (ms):  lower=2.9  compile=0.43  run=0.08  bridge=0.002

(Was 21.8 ms total before the short-circuits landed.)

Set `NIX_VM_STATS=1` to see hook invocation counts; `V3_TIMING=1`
adds per-phase timing (lower / compile / run / bridge):

    NIX_VM_STATS=1 V3_TIMING=1 NIX_USE_V3=1 nix eval --json --expr '...'

## Benchmark harness

`src/libexpr-v3/test/bench-v3-vs-tw.sh` times v3 vs. tree-walker
across a fixed set of workloads.  Use it to attribute every "perf
win" commit to a measurable delta.

    # Default: 3 runs/cell, table output.  Synthetic workloads only.
    bash src/libexpr-v3/test/bench-v3-vs-tw.sh

    # Add nixpkgs workloads.
    NPK=$HOME/src/nixpkgs bash src/libexpr-v3/test/bench-v3-vs-tw.sh

    # Higher run count for tighter stats.
    N=10 bash src/libexpr-v3/test/bench-v3-vs-tw.sh

    # Subset by workload name.
    ONLY=fib35,letrec-fix bash src/libexpr-v3/test/bench-v3-vs-tw.sh

    # Raw CSV (one row per run) for graphing.
    FORMAT=csv N=20 bash src/libexpr-v3/test/bench-v3-vs-tw.sh \
        > /tmp/bench-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).csv

Workloads cover compute-bound (fib35, ackermann), attrset path
chains (path-deep, letrec-fix), and -- when nixpkgs is available --
the nixpkgs-cold-path queries dominant in real-world use
(hello-name, git-name, drv3, attr-pkgs, attr-hask).

## Resource limits — `NIX_V3_MAX_*` (Phase 1.6, 2026-05-18)

Three opt-in caps, each gracefully throws a typed exception
within ~10 ms of the cap being exceeded.  Default-off — set the
env var to enable.

| Env var | Suffixes | Exception |
|---|---|---|
| `NIX_V3_MAX_HEAP` | K / M / G (1024-base; B optional) | `OutOfMemoryError` |
| `NIX_V3_MAX_CPU_TIME` | s / m / h | `CpuTimeExceededError` |
| `NIX_V3_MAX_WALL_TIME` | s / m / h | `WallTimeExceededError` |

Examples:

```
# Fail fast (≤ ~2s + 100 ms slack) on an infinite tail recursion.
NIX_V3_MAX_WALL_TIME=2s v3-eval --expr 'let f = x: f x; in f 0'

# Cap an eval to 30 CPU-seconds (catches busy loops that drift
# across wall time due to thermal throttling).
NIX_V3_MAX_CPU_TIME=30s v3-eval --file workload.nix

# Cap Boehm heap at 1 GiB — best-effort; Boehm's
# GC_set_max_heap_size is approximate.  For deterministic OOM
# enforcement on production, also set the OS-level
# `setrlimit RLIMIT_AS` via the shell (`ulimit -v 1048576`).
NIX_V3_MAX_HEAP=1G v3-eval --file workload.nix
```

Exception output (stderr):

```
v3-eval error: v3 WallTimeExceededError: NIX_V3_MAX_WALL_TIME=2.00s exceeded
after 2.00s (alloc: closures=1 thunks=1 lists=0 attrsets=1
rss=25.55 MB boehm_heap=384.25 MB)
```

Polling cadence is every 10 000 opcodes (`kPollInterval` in
`limits.cc`).  Per-opcode amortised cost when caps are inactive:
**zero** (the entire poll site elides to one branch-predicted-not-
taken branch).  Per-opcode amortised cost when caps are active:
~1-2 ns (a thread-local counter increment + comparison).

The bench harness (`bench/bench.py`) sets all three by default
(4G / 300s / 600s) so accidental hot-loops fail-fast instead of
stalling the runner.  Override per-invocation:

```
nix develop -c python3 src/libexpr-v3/bench/bench.py \
    --max-heap 8G --cpu-budget 60s --wall-budget 120s \
    --modes tw,v3-direct -n 5

# Disable all caps:
nix develop -c python3 src/libexpr-v3/bench/bench.py --no-caps ...
```

## IFD visibility (WS-2, 2026-07-13)

Import-from-derivation (IFD) builds block evaluation synchronously — they are
the dominant wall-clock cost of IFD-heavy CI evals.  Two layers make them
visible; both were previously off by default.

### Default-on v3 summary (no flag)

Every v3-direct eval that performs a context-bearing IFD-class read
(`import` / `readFile` / `readDir` / `pathExists` / `readFileType` /
`findFile` / `scopedImport` / `hashFile` over a `"${drv}/…"` path) prints one
line to **stderr** at end of eval:

```
v3: IFD — 12 context-bearing IFD-class read(s): import=8 readFile=4; \
   blocked 4.213s in realise across 12 call(s) (63.7% of 6.610s eval wall). \
   Per-derivation build/substitute/ms detail: --option profile-import-from-derivation true
```

It is **silent** when no IFD occurred (pure eval / `nix build` of a
non-IFD derivation), so it never pollutes the common case.  The value is
printed to stdout *after* this line, so `nix eval … | tail -1` still captures
the result.  `blocked … in realise` is wall-time spent in the realise FFI leaf
(IFD builds/substitutions + already-valid checks); on a WARM CI rerun (IFDs
already in the store) it collapses to the already-valid check cost, so the
percentage tells you how much of the *warm* eval is still IFD-bound.

### Per-derivation detail (opt-in setting)

`--option profile-import-from-derivation true` makes the tree-walker log each
IFD as it happens and export totals into `NIX_SHOW_STATS`:

```
nix eval --impure --option profile-import-from-derivation true \
    --show-stats --expr '…'
# stderr:  IFD #1: /nix/store/…-foo.drv^out [built] 2986ms at file.nix:3:2
# stats JSON:  "nrIFDs": 3, "nrIFDsCached": 1, "totalIFDTimeUs": 9123456
```

Recommended in CI: enable `profile-import-from-derivation` and capture
`NIX_SHOW_STATS` so every job records its IFD count + total build time.
`bench/ifd-decomp.sh` wraps this to report the wall decomposition (compute vs
IFD-blocked vs store-RPC) per workload.

## Persistent worker mode for CI (WS-3, 2026-07-13)

CI re-runs the same / near-same evals many times.  A fresh `nix` per run
throws away the in-process caches — worst of all the applied-import "moat"
cache, which is keyed on a raw descriptor pointer and cannot exist across
processes.  `v3-eval --worker` keeps ONE process alive and streams evals, so
those caches persist and reruns are near-free.

### W1 — the worker (`v3-eval --worker`)

Reads one expression per stdin line; prints each result followed by a blank
delimiter line.  A per-request error prints `<error>` and the worker
continues.  Between requests the impurity taint is reset and the resource
limits are re-armed; the import + applied caches deliberately persist.

```
printf '%s\n' \
  '(import <nixpkgs> {}).hello.name' \
  '(import <nixpkgs> {}).git.name' \
  | NIX_V3_DIRECT_EVAL=1 v3-eval --worker
```

Measured (laptop, pinned `<nixpkgs>`): fresh-process warm eval ≈ **109 ms**
each; in a worker, eval #1 ≈ 109 ms but **eval #2..N ≈ 0.1 ms** — the applied
cache serves the memoised result.  Correctness gate: eval #1 == eval #2 ==
fresh-process result, byte-for-byte (`test/run-worker-mode-tests.sh`).

### W2 — memory

Repeated identical evals do **not** leak: worker peak RSS is flat across
10→200 evals (~114–172 MB, no growth).  For a long-lived worker fed
*unbounded-distinct* inputs, bound the import cache with
`NIX_V3_IMPORT_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES=<n>` (default 0 = never evict — fine for the
repeated-CI case, where the distinct-import set is bounded by nixpkgs).  A
zygote-style respawn after N evals or an RSS ceiling is the belt-and-braces
option for truly unbounded streams.

### W3 — ship an AOT cache in the CI image (`make aot-cache-ci`)

The AOT cache file (`NIX_V3_AOT_CACHE_FILE`) is a read-only mmap consulted
before SQLite; N parallel evals share its pages.  Build + verify it for your
CI's workload:

```
nix develop -c make -C src/libexpr-v3 aot-cache-ci \
    WORKLOAD='(import <nixpkgs> {}).hello.name' OUT=/img/v3-aot.bin
# → packs the CUs/IFD-results the workload touches, then verifies a fresh
#   process hits >= 95% from the file (measured 157/157 = 100%).
# In CI:  export NIX_V3_AOT_CACHE_FILE=/img/v3-aot.bin
```

### W4 — SQLite disk-cache growth policy (wipe-per-image)

The SQLite disk cache (`CompilationUnits` / `EvalResults`) has **no runtime
eviction** — the LRU bump was deliberately removed (per-hit writes cost more
than they save), so the DB grows unboundedly.  **Policy: wipe it per CI image
build**, not evict at runtime.  Rationale: the AOT file (W3) is the immutable,
distributable warm cache for the image; the SQLite DB is only a local warm-up
scratch that a fresh image rebuilds.  Runtime LRU eviction is explicitly NOT
implemented (it would reintroduce the per-hit write cost for no CI benefit).
Set `NIX_V3_CACHE_DIR` to an image-local path and clear it on image rebuild.

## Profiling workflow (2026-05-18)

Two complementary profiling tools, layered for different
granularities:

### Per-opcode dispatch counter (in-process, low overhead)

Set `NIX_VM_OPCOUNTS=1` alongside `NIX_VM_STATS=1` to get a sorted
top-20 hot opcodes report:

    NIX_VM_OPCOUNTS=1 NIX_VM_STATS=1 \
      ./build/src/libexpr-v3/v3-eval --strict --expr "EXPR"

Example output:

    v3 opcode profile (total=14018, top 20 of 10 distinct):
      OP_GET_LOCAL                       4005 (28.57%)
      OP_SET_LOCAL                       2005 (14.30%)
      OP_FORCE                           2001 (14.27%)
      OP_RETURN                          2000 (14.27%)
      OP_MAKE_CLOSURE                    1002 ( 7.15%)
      OP_CALL_PRIMOP                     1002 ( 7.15%)
      OP_GET_UPVALUE                     1000 ( 7.13%)
      OP_STR_CONCAT                      1000 ( 7.13%)
      ...

Tells you which dispatch branches dominate.  Each percentage
point above ~5% is a worthwhile fast-path or peephole candidate
(e.g. `GET_LOCAL`+`FORCE` adjacency is already fused as
`OP_GET_LOCAL_FORCE`; a high `OP_FORCE` percentage suggests the
fusion isn't kicking in on the workload — investigate).

**Overhead**: one extra memory write per dispatch.  Measured ~3-5%
on tight inner loops.  Tolerable for profiling sessions; do not
ship default-on.

### Sampling CPU profiler (OS-level, all overhead)

For finer-grained call-graph data (which C++ function is hot, not
just which opcode), use the OS sampling profiler.

**macOS — Instruments**:

    # 1. Run the workload in the foreground; let Instruments attach.
    NIX_V3_DIRECT_EVAL=1 ./build/src/libexpr-v3/v3-eval \
        --file /path/to/heavy.nix --strict &
    PID=$!
    # 2. Profile for 5 seconds, save to /tmp/v3.trace.
    xcrun xctrace record --template "Time Profiler" \
        --output /tmp/v3.trace --attach $PID --time-limit 5s
    # 3. Open the trace in Instruments.app to drill into call paths.
    open /tmp/v3.trace

**Linux — perf**:

    # Record at 999Hz for the duration of the eval.

**What to look for**:
- `dispatchLoop` and its inlined opcode handlers should dominate
  (>50% inclusive).  If a primop body (e.g. `primDerivationStrict`)
  outranks dispatch, the primop is the bottleneck — focus there.
- Boehm GC functions (`GC_*`) appearing in the top-N indicates
  alloc-heavy paths.  Cross-reference with the alloc stats output
  (`closures=N thunks=M`) to localise the alloc site.
- `callClosure` and `forceValue` (C-recursive paths) appearing
  high suggests the iterative-force conversion isn't covering some
  shape — that's a Phase 1.2 / A12b follow-up.

### Composing the two

A typical session: run the workload under `NIX_VM_OPCOUNTS=1` first
to identify the hot opcodes; then run under `perf record` to see
WHERE those opcodes' C++ handlers spend their time.  The two views
together answer "which dispatch branches dominate" + "what does
each branch do that's slow."

## CO-2 / CO-3: forceValue cutover (opt-in)

Set `NIX_USE_V3_FORCE=1` (in addition to `NIX_USE_V3=1`) to enable
the forceValue cutover hook.  When the lowered+compiled v3 module
recorded an Expr* match for a given thunk-body, force-time
dispatch to that v3 function instead of tree-walker's expr->eval.

Stats with the force hook on:

    v3 force stats: forceEntries=N forceHits=H forceMisses=M skippedNeedsUpvalues=S

What the counters mean:
  - `forceEntries`: every forceValue call where the Expr* lookup
    fired; dominated by sub-Expr forces.
  - `forceHits`: cache hit + actually ran in v3.
  - `forceMisses`: cache miss; fell through to expr->eval.
  - `skippedNeedsUpvalues`: cache hit, but the function needs
    upvalues we can't yet translate from tree-walker's env.
    Phase B (task #278) unblocks these.

Currently the force hook is a small *regression* on real-world
workloads (~8% slower on hello.name) because the per-call hash-map
lookup outweighs the few hits that don't need upvalues.  Phase B
lifts the upvalue restriction, at which point most thunks can
flow through v3 and the trade-off should reverse.

## What the lowerer supports

Literals: `Int`, `Float`, `Bool`, `Null`, `String`, `Path`.

Operators:
  - Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` (mixed Int/Float promoted)
  - Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` (via primops + lowering)
  - Logical: `&&`, `||`, `->`, `!` (short-circuit branches via inline
    sub-blocks)
  - String/numeric coercion via `+` (the parser desugars to
    `ConcatStrings`; the VM dispatches on operand types)
  - Attrset update `//`
  - List concat `++`

Control flow:
  - `if-then-else`
  - `with attrs; body` (runtime with-stack)
  - `assert cond; body`

Bindings (full mutual recursion):
  - `let x = a; y = b; in body` — env-carrier letrec.  References
    inside thunk bodies and the body itself resolve via
    AttrSelect+Force on the rec attrset, so mutual recursion works.
  - `inherit a b c;`
  - `inherit (from) a b;`  (for both rec and non-rec attrsets)
  - `rec { ... }` — same env-carrier path as let.

Functions:
  - Plain lambdas: `x: body`
  - Formals: `{a, b ? def, ...}: body` and `x@{a, b}: body`
    (defaults supported; `...` accepted)
  - Application (curried via repeated OP_CALL)

Attrsets / lists / select:
  - `{ a = 1; b = 2; }` (non-recursive)
  - `rec { ... }` (recursive)
  - `attrs.a.b.c` (chained static select with implicit Force)
  - `attrs.a.b.c or default` (any path length; default applies if any
    segment is missing — short-circuit chain of HasAttr)
  - `attrs ? a` (single-element hasAttr)
  - List literals; `++` concat

Primops (81 registered in v3's own registry):

Lists / collections:
  length, head, tail, elemAt, concatLists, concatMap, partition, sort,
  map, filter, foldl', genList, all, any, elem, splitString,
  concatStringsSep

Attrsets:
  attrNames, attrValues, getAttr, hasAttr, removeAttrs, intersectAttrs,
  mapAttrs, listToAttrs, catAttrs, groupBy, genericClosure,
  functionArgs

Type predicates / coercion:
  isAttrs, isList, isFunction, isString, isInt, isBool, isNull,
  isFloat, isPath, typeOf, toString, stringLength, parseInt

Arithmetic / numeric:
  add, sub, mul, div, lessThan, bitAnd, bitOr, bitXor, floor, ceil,
  compareVersions, parseDrvName

Strings:
  substring, replaceStrings, match, split, hashString (FNV stub)

I/O / files:
  readFile, readDir, pathExists, baseNameOf, dirOf, import

JSON:
  toJSON, fromJSON

Evaluation control:
  throw, abort, seq, deepSeq, tryEval

System info (0-arity):
  currentSystem, currentTime, nixVersion, getEnv

Internals (parser desugaring):
  __add, __sub, __mul, __div, __lessThan

The lowerer detects `builtins.<name>` and `__<name>` patterns at the
ExprCall callee site and emits a direct `OP_CALL_PRIMOP` (no Closure
allocation, no PrimOpApp).  `builtins.<name>` for arity-0 primops is
auto-invoked at access time; for higher arity it produces a
Tag::PrimOp value that participates in PrimOpApp partial application.

## Known limitations

Store / derivation primops:
  - derivationStrict / builtins.path: bridged to tree-walker under
    settings.readOnlyMode = true, so they produce deterministic
    `/nix/store/<32-char-hash>-name` paths.  The bridge fails for
    inputs containing a v3 closure (e.g. `builtins.path { filter = ...; }`)
    and falls back to a fake `/v3-fake-store/<16-hex-hash>-name`.
  - scopedImport: works (synthesises `__scope__: let foo = __scope__.foo;
    bar = __scope__.bar; ... in (<imported file>)` to shadow base-env
    primops the same way tree-walker stacks a new StaticEnv).
  - findFile / __findFile (NIX_PATH + corepkgs `<nix/...>` lookup): works.
  - Path interpolation `${./file}` produces the proper
    `/nix/store/<32-hash>-name` form via tree-walker's copyPathToStore.
  - exec, filterSource, importNative, outputOf, toFile, fetchurl,
    fetchTarball — not implemented.
  - String contexts: tracked via a side-table keyed by Tag::String
    payload pointer.  Path interpolation `${./file}` tags the result
    with an Opaque context entry; tree-walker strings (e.g. drvPath,
    outPath via the derivation bridge) preserve their context across
    the bridge.  All context primops work: getContext, hasContext,
    unsafeDiscardStringContext, unsafeDiscardOutputDependency,
    addDrvOutputDependencies, appendContext.

Lazy evaluation:
  - Mutually-circular formal defaults like `{ a ? b, b ? a }: ...`
    when only one side is provided.  Tree-walker uses per-default
    thunks; v3 currently reads sibling slots eagerly.  Forward refs
    (`b ? a + 1`) and backward refs (`a ? b - 1`) work fine.
  - Delayed `with` works: with-stack entries are pushed unforced and
    forced lazily on lookup.  Blackholes that bubble out from a
    deeper force are skipped so outer scopes still get a chance.

Coercion in interpolation: int/float/bool/null/string/path/attrset-
with-__toString-or-outPath are supported; lists still need explicit
conversion.

Position tracking: `__curPos` materializes {file, line, column} for
the call site.  `unsafeGetAttrPos` and `functionArgs`-derived
positions both work via the per-attr position side-table populated
by OP_ATTRS_INIT[_DYN] / OP_ATTRS_REC_INIT.

Performance: v3 is at parity with the tree-walker on compute-bound
benchmarks and on real-world nixpkgs evaluation, and significantly
faster on attrset-heavy workloads.

  fib30:  tree-walker 0.37s user, v3 0.35s user  (slightly faster
                                                    after TCO + slot elision)
  fib32:  tree-walker 0.93s user, v3 0.94s user  (~1% gap)
  fib34:  tree-walker 2.41s user, v3 2.42s user  (~0.5% gap)
  attrs10k (10000 // merges + foldl' over attrNames):
          tree-walker 0.34s user, v3 0.10s user  (3.4× faster)
  haskellPackages attrNames length:
          tree-walker 0.44s user, v3 0.44s user  (matched)
  pkgs.stdenv attrNames length:
          tree-walker 0.24s user, v3 0.23s user  (matched)
  pkgs.hello.meta.description:
          tree-walker 0.23s user, v3 0.23s user  (matched)
  cardano-node flake evaluation (warm cache):
          tree-walker 0.43s user / 3.65s real,
                v3 0.43s user / 3.61s real  (matched)

Real-package instantiation through `nix-instantiate --dry-run`
(produces a /nix/store/...drv path).  v3 produces byte-identical
drvPaths to tree-walker and is consistently a few % faster:

  hello: tree-walker 0.28s user, v3 0.26s user (~7% faster)
  vim:   tree-walker 0.28s user, v3 0.27s user (~3% faster)
  git:   tree-walker 0.39s user, v3 0.37s user (~5% faster)

Heavy nixpkgs scan — filter+count all 25 070 top-level package
attrsets (`builtins.length (builtins.filter (n: builtins.isAttrs
(tryEval pkgs.${n}).value) (attrNames pkgs))`).  Both produce 25070:
  tree-walker: 9.06s user / 10.68s real
  v3:          8.95s user /  7.78s real  (~1% less CPU, ~27% less wall)

NixOS module evaluation — full sample config with grub / firewall /
ssh / nginx / postgresql / users / packages.  Both produce 59
systemd services:
  tree-walker: 0.59s user / 0.73s real
  v3:          0.59s user / 0.75s real  (matched)

Tail-call optimization: 100,000 recursive tail calls
(`let f = n: if n == 100000 then n else f (n + 1); in f 0`) now
runs in O(1) frame stack space.  Bounded against true infinite
recursion (`(x: x x) (x: x x)`) by a 10⁷ tail-call iteration
counter that resets on any non-tail call/return.

Recent perf wins (in-VM hot path):
  - OP_FORCE peek-fast-path: skip pop+push when top is already WHNF.
  - OP_SET_LOCAL fast-path: skip the grow loop when slot is in range.
  - Superinstructions OP_GET_LOCAL_FORCE / OP_GET_UPVALUE_FORCE: fuse
    the var-load+force pair (the most common bytecode pair).
  - OP_STR_CONCAT 2-int fast-path: every `a + b` over ints sums
    in-place on the operand stack without allocating.
  - OP_EQ / OP_NEQ / OP_LESS int-int fast paths: every numeric
    predicate inlines the comparison without a helper call.

Still queued for the larger wins: NaN-boxing, computed-goto dispatch,
Bindings polymorphism, OP_ATTRS_SELECT inline cache (already done for
the simple case).

## Test status

The official `tests/functional/lang/eval-okay-*.nix` lang suite:
**142 / 142 passing** (one test is `.exp-disabled` upstream).  Run via:

    bash src/libexpr-v3/test/run-lang-tests.sh

The official `tests/functional/lang/eval-fail-*.nix` lang suite:
**103 / 109 raise the expected error**, zero crashes.  The 6 remaining
silent passes are intentional divergences:

- 4 require tree-walker-specific lint flags
  (`--lint-absolute-path-literals fatal` etc.): abs-path-fatal,
  home-path-fatal, short-path-literal, url-literal.  These test
  tree-walker features v3 does not implement.
- 2 expect a stack-overflow trap on deep recursion: toJSON-stack-overflow,
  derivation-structuredAttrs-stack-overflow.  v3's iterative toJSON
  succeeds where tree-walker overflows — divergence is by design.

Run via:

    bash src/libexpr-v3/test/run-fail-tests.sh

The 77-case v3-vs-tree-walker regression suite at
`src/libexpr-v3/test/run-v3-tests.sh`: 76/77 passing (1 display-only).

End-to-end cutover validation via the regular `nix-instantiate` CLI
with `NIX_USE_V3=1` set — exercises the libnixexpr → libnixexprv3
hook + result-conversion shim:

    bash src/libexpr-v3/test/run-cutover-tests.sh

**142 / 142 passing** (all upstream eval-okay tests, including
those with `.flags` files like `--lint-absolute-path-literals`,
`--extra-experimental-features parse-toml-timestamps`, and
`-I` lookup-path entries).

## Recent feature additions

`builtins` as a standalone value: produces an attrset of all
registered primops on demand (used by `with builtins; …` and
`inherit (builtins) substring;`).

Cross-CU calls: closures returned from `builtins.import` now carry
their own CompilationUnit so cross-file `(import lib.nix) attrs`
patterns work.  primImport caches CUs in a process-global ImportCache
so the bytecode they own outlives any closure that points into it.

Lazy attrset values: every non-trivial attribute value is wrapped in
a thunk at lowering time, so building `{a = 1; b = throw "x";}`
doesn't fire the throw until `b` is forced.  Trivial values
(literals, var refs, lambdas) skip the wrapper.

Lazy function args: non-primop calls thunkify their non-trivial
arguments so `f (throw "x")` only throws when `f` actually demands
the value.

Dynamic attr names in nested select: `attrs.${k}.deeper` works.
Dynamic attrs (`{ ${name} = value; }`) work as the top-level
attrset; rec + dynamic combination is still rejected.

Mutually-recursive lambda formals (one-direction): `{a, b ? a + 1}`,
`{a ? b - 1, b ? 10}` and `{a ? 1, b ? a}` all lower correctly.
Symmetric circular defaults `{a ? b, b ? a}` still fail eagerly.

App / lazy-callback primops: `mapAttrs` builds Tag::App entries that
defer the `fn name value` call until the entry is forced — matches
tree-walker laziness, fixes `intersectAttrs` against
`mapAttrs throw alphabet`.

Multi-arg primop callbacks via callClosure: builds PrimOpApp on
under-application and walks a PrimOpApp chain to invoke once the
arity is reached.  Fixes `sort builtins.lessThan list-of-lists`.
