// once a namespace-scope `const bool g_phaseDActive` (read via the inline
// phaseDActive() in barrier.hh) so barrier emits loaded a byte instead of
// paying the magic-static guard the prior function-local form required.  The
// NIX_V3_NURSERY opt-out was RETIRED (2026-06-15; the flip soaked clean across
// all of nixpkgs on darwin-4, 24882 attrs / 0 divergence), so the gate is
// permanently true.  phaseDActive() is now `constexpr … return true`
// (barrier.hh), which folds the barrier guards at compile time across all TUs
// even without LTO — strictly better than the extern-const load — so the
// g_phaseDActive definition it depended on is removed here.
