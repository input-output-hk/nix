/// Bytecode primop infrastructure (T0 — A12b architectural refactor).
///
/// The C primops in primops.cc that take user lambdas as arguments
/// (map / filter / foldl' / concatMap / mapAttrs / etc.) invoke those
/// lambdas via `callClosure(vm, op, arg)`, which C-recurses into
/// dispatchLoop.  On deep eval graphs (stdenv.mkDerivation × transitive
/// dependencies), this is the dominant C-stack consumer and the root
/// cause of the depth=5000 SIGSEGV documented in
/// `memory/project_a12b_depth5000.md`.
///
/// The fix: replace those C primops with hand-written Nix-source
/// templates that use ONLY non-callback primops (length, elemAt,
/// arithmetic) for their bodies plus OP_CALL on the user lambda.
/// At runtime, the inner OP_CALL dispatches through dispatchLoop
/// iteratively (per commit 7f5a392f4) — no C-recursion.  The
/// recursive helper inside each template is rewritten to OP_TAIL_CALL
/// by emit.cc's tail-call peephole, so the loop runs in O(1)
/// vm.frames depth regardless of input size.
///
/// `installBytecodePrimop` compiles a Nix-source primop body at v3
/// init time and replaces the corresponding entry in TW's builtins
/// attrset with a v3-Closure-wrapped-as-TW-value (via
/// `v3ToTreeWalkerPublic`).  Both v3-direct and TW dispatch through
/// the bridged value; v3-direct unwraps it and runs the inner
/// closure on the current VM (`tryUnwrapBridge1Closure` shortcut in
/// OP_CALL, vm.cc:2920).
///
/// Property tests in `test/property/property_tests.py` ensure that
/// each replacement preserves TW's exact semantics on randomized
/// inputs; lang-test parity covers the static corpus.
