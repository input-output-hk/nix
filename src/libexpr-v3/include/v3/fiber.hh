/// WC-18 Fiber: lightweight cooperative coroutine for v3↔tree-walker
/// bridge isolation.
///
/// v3's bytecode dispatcher runs on its own stack (separate from the
/// caller's pthread stack).  Cross-VM transitions (forcing tree-walker
/// values, calling tree-walker primops) yield to a driver that
/// performs the action on the caller's stack and resumes the fiber.
/// Result: v3 bytecode evaluation depth is decoupled from the caller's
/// C stack; cross-CU eval-order divergences (WC-17 finding) no longer
/// blow up the C stack of the calling thread.
///
/// Implementation notes:
///   - macOS arm64 has `ucontext_t` available; deprecated since 10.6,
///     but still functional.  We wrap the deprecation warnings.
///   - Default stack size: 16 MiB, mmap'd.  A guard page below the
///     stack catches overflow.
///   - Fibers are NOT GC roots — Boehm scans the active thread's
///     pthread stack only.  WC-13 already registered the v3 arena
///     as a GC root; the only fiber-stack values that matter for GC
///     are tree-walker `nix::Value *` arguments to yields, which the
///     mailbox holds — and the mailbox lives on the driver's stack
///     (which IS scanned).  No additional GC integration needed.
///
///     GC_AUDIT_ROUND_2 N2 (LATENT, documented 2026-05-21): the
///     paragraph above predates the v3 nursery scavenger.  Boehm
///     scans the driver's pthread stack, but the v3 scavenger does
///     NOT — and a yielded fiber's `fiberVm` is invisible to a
///     scavenge fired from a re-entry on a FRESH VMState (driver
///     callback path).  Two pre-flips are required before enabling
///     `NIX_V3_FIBER_BRIDGE`:
///       (1) `GC_add_roots(stack, stack+stackSize)` in
///           `fiberCreate` + `GC_remove_roots` in `fiberDestroy`, so
///           Boehm covers TW Value pointers held on the fiber stack.
///       (2) The scavenger must walk every live fiber's `fiberVm`
///           (currently only walks the VMState handed to `run()`
///           and any in `activeVMStack`; a yielded fiber is in
///           neither).
///     See `lode/GC_AUDIT_ROUND_2_2026-05-21.md` §2.2 N2 for the
///     full diagnosis + sites.
