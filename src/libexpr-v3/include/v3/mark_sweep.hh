/// Stage 6 production GC — flat mark-sweep over the v3 tenured arena.
///
/// Per `lode/GC_DESIGN_POST_CHENEY_2026-05-28.md` §4-§6 (the design
/// post-Cheney falsification).  Replaces the Cheney semispace
/// machinery (move_gc.cc + major_scavenge.hh) which was falsified at
/// commit eda44711a — Cheney's 1.5-1.7x peak factor at v3's high
/// live-fraction made it strictly worse than the no-GC baseline.
///
/// ## Design summary (Day 6, 2026-05-28)
///
///   1. Walk all precise roots via `walkAllV3Roots` (Stage 3), marking
///      each reachable cell in a per-block mark bitmap (Phase 1).
///   2. Sweep each arena block: for each unmarked cell address, insert
///      into a per-size-class free list.  Cells stay IN PLACE (no
///      copy, no 2x peak).  Free blocks (those with zero marked cells)
///      get returned to libc (Phase 2).
///   3. Allocator fast path: bump within current block; slow path:
///      check size-class free list first (Phase 3).
///
/// Falsifier results justifying this design (per
/// `STAGE_6_FALSIFIERS_DAY6_2026-05-28.md`):
///   * F#1 line-occupancy: 46.5% hello / 50.5% HNE lines fully dead;
///     both flat MS and Immix viable.
///   * F#2 mark cost (realistic bitmap): 0.8% hello / 1.8% HNE wall.
///   * Flat MS reclaims 12% more bytes per cycle than Immix
///     (cell-granularity vs line-granularity).
///   * Implementation budget 1.5-2 KLoC, 2-3 weeks.
///
/// ## Cost when not invoked
///
/// The trigger in vm.cc dispatch-loop is gated `NIX_V3_MAJOR_GC=1`
/// (default OFF; production unaffected).  When gate is OFF this
/// function is never called and the implementation pays nothing.
