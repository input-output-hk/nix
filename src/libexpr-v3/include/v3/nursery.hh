        // (Boehm-managed) `nix::Value*`s, and the Bridge thunk
        // header itself sits in nursery memory.  When Boehm runs
        // its own collection (it can fire any time during the
        // primop callback chain that bypass triggers), it walks
        // the GC roots looking for live TW values.  The nursery
        // is NOT a Boehm root, so the bridge's `bridgeSrc` ->
        // `nix::Value*` chain is invisible; Boehm reclaims TW
        // values that v3 still references.  Subsequent dereference
        // through the Bridge segfaults / SIGTRAPs.
        //
        // Why the regression suite missed this: synthetic tests
        // produce TW values only via known-rooted paths (TW eval
        // owns the values; Boehm has its own roots into them).
        // The libsForQt5 bypass + nixpkgs eval routes
        // treeWalkerToV3 through chains where the only path to a
        // TW value is via a v3 nursery cell.

        // Why a 512 MB nursery still crashes (no scavenge fires):
        // the bug is in the ROUTING (nursery memory invisible to
