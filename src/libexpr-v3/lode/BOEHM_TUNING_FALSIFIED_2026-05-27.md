# Boehm tuning spike (§6.2) — FALSIFIED on macOS aarch64

**Date**: 2026-05-27
**Setup**: cppnix on macOS aarch64 with Boehm 8.2.8 from nixpkgs
**Workload**: `(import <nixpkgs> {}).hello.drvPath` under v3-direct
**Goal**: per IDEAL_GC_DESIGN §6.2, attempt the "1 day, 100-300 MB
recovery" Boehm-tuning spike before committing to Stages 5-6 effort.

## Hypothesis

Boehm's heap shows 402.9 MB total, 402.8 MB free (99.9 %) on
hello.drvPath.  Tuning Boehm's free-space divisor and forcing
explicit unmap should release the 400 MB watermark back to the OS.

## Procedure

Three runtime knobs tried (each is the documented Boehm API for the
suspected mechanism):

1. `GC_set_free_space_divisor(30)` — target only ~3 % free instead
   of default 33 %.  Should drive more frequent collection +
   smaller watermark.
2. `GC_gcollect_and_unmap()` — explicit "collect + unmap" call,
   documented in Boehm 8.2.8 as the unconditional unmap path.
3. `GC_set_force_unmap_on_gcollect(1)` — flag that gates whether
   explicit collects also unmap (defaults off).

Wired into `limits.cc::initLimits` and `run.cc`'s end-of-eval stats
path, with `boehm_unmapped = GC_get_unmapped_bytes()` added to the
"v3-direct memory:" report line for direct verification.

## Result

```
                                             boehm_heap  boehm_free  boehm_unmapped  peak_rss  gc_count
BASELINE                                       402.9 MB    402.8 MB        0.0 MB     753.8 MB   1
FREE_DIV=30 (target 3 % free)                  402.9 MB    402.8 MB        0.0 MB     753.5 MB   1
FORCE_UNMAP=1 (GC_gcollect_and_unmap, no flag) 402.9 MB    402.8 MB        0.0 MB     770.4 MB  13
FORCE_UNMAP=1 + force_unmap_on_gcollect(1)     402.9 MB    402.8 MB        0.0 MB     770.0 MB  13
```

**`boehm_unmapped` never moved off zero**, even with the documented
"force unmap + explicit unmap-collect" combination.  The 402.9 MB
heap watermark is structural — Boehm in this build sees 402.8 MB
free, but does not release the pages to the OS.

## Why the mechanism doesn't fire

The library is linked with `_munmap` (verified via `nm`) and exports
`GC_get_unmapped_bytes` (returns 0), so munmap support is compiled
in.  But every arena block of `threadArena` is registered with Boehm
via `GC_add_roots` (`alloc.hh::refill`, lines 698-708).  Boehm
conservatively scans those arena blocks for pointers into its heap;
on a multi-GB arena that scan likely finds ambiguous pointer-shaped
bit patterns on the order of "small enough to think a Boehm chunk
is referenced."  Even with `GC_set_force_unmap_on_gcollect(1)` and
13 explicit collections, no chunk crossed the internal
`GC_UNMAP_THRESHOLD` of 6 consecutive empty cycles required to
mark it unmappable.

In other words: the cheap-knob fix doesn't work because the v3
arena is BOTH huge AND registered as a Boehm root — Boehm
permanently sees enough false-positive pointer alias risk to
pin all its empty chunks.

## Decision per Rule 0

This is the falsifier.  The §6.2 "cheap-knob 100-300 MB recovery"
path is **FALSIFIED on this platform / library combination**.

What remains live:
* **§6.1 precise-root infrastructure** (Stages 4-6 in the foundation
  doc) — confirmed SHIP-GREEN via the live-fraction spike
  (`LIVE_FRACTION_SPIKE_2026-05-27.md`).  239 MB freeable on
  hello.drvPath; that path is the one that delivers.
* **Architectural Boehm replacement** — bigger project.  Not in
  reach this turn.

What's removed:
* The Boehm-tuning sub-track is closed.  Future "let's just tune
  Boehm" suggestions need to first demonstrate `boehm_unmapped`
  moves off zero on macOS aarch64.

## Follow-up probe: periodic `GC_gcollect()` from `checkLimits`

Added `NIX_V3_BOEHM_PERIODIC_GC=1` to fire one explicit `GC_gcollect()`
per `checkLimits()` poll.  Confirms the mechanism but the gate is
not viable for production:

```
                                             boehm_heap  boehm_unmapped  peak_rss  gc_count  wall
BASELINE                                       402.9 MB        0.0 MB    753.8 MB     1     1.31 s
PERIODIC_GC=1                                    1.4 MB      401.5 MB    767.6 MB  1500    11.82 s
```

**Mechanism confirmed**: Boehm DOES unmap pages when collection is
forced.  `boehm_unmapped=401.5 MB` is real release back to the OS.

**But peak_rss got WORSE**: the watermark was already hit before
the first GC could fire; subsequent collections only released
back AFTER peak.  Plus +14 MB on peak from GC's own working set.

**And wall regressed 9×**: 1.31 s → 11.82 s.  64.5 s of total GC
time per run.  Each collection scans 587 MB of arena (every
threadArena block is registered as a Boehm root via
`alloc.hh:706`), making per-collection cost ~40 ms × 1500
collections ≈ 60 s.

### What this teaches about Stage 6 design

The fundamental issue: **the arena being registered with Boehm
makes Boehm collection prohibitively expensive**.  Boehm chooses
to grow rather than collect because each collection is 40 ms.

Stage 6's architectural fix MUST include arena deregistration —
remove the `GC_add_roots(blk, blk + kBlockSize)` call from
`refill()`.  Then Boehm has only its own heap to scan (cheap)
and auto-collection becomes viable.

Required for arena deregistration: a side-table of every
`nix::Value*` (bridge thunks etc.) stored in arena cells.  That
side-table becomes Boehm's root view of the v3-arena content.
~1-2 days of careful work.

This is now a **concrete Stage 6 sub-task** (was previously
hand-waved as "Boehm continues to manage TW-side").

## What this turn LANDS regardless

The instrumentation is no-regret:
* `boehm_unmapped` is now in the `v3-direct memory:` stats line —
  any future Boehm tuning attempt can verify mechanism behaviour
  in one run.
* `NIX_V3_BOEHM_FREE_DIV` env-gate remains in `initLimits` — costs
  one cached-bool branch per process, future-proofs against
  newer Boehm versions where the mechanism might differ.
* `NIX_V3_BOEHM_FORCE_UNMAP` env-gate remains as the diagnostic
  switch — falsifies any reopening of the §6.2 hypothesis.
* `NIX_V3_BOEHM_PERIODIC_GC` env-gate — confirms the unmap
  mechanism + measures the per-collect cost.  Catastrophic
  9× wall regression rules out production default-on; valuable
  as a Stage 6 design probe.

All gates carry inline retirement criteria.
