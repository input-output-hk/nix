# v3 memory — integrated forward plan (2026-06-14)

Synthesises the reviewer's root analysis (`WHY_V3_USES_MORE_MEMORY_2026-06-14.md`,
968d5fd0e) with this session's measured findings into a single actionable plan.

## The reframe (why the per-lever hunt failed)
v3's memory excess is **not a single removable structure** — it is a DISTRIBUTED
per-object constant tax + unreclaimed churn + stranded dead, in three layers:
- **A — per-object live tax (~1.4× TW):** thunk 40 B header + 8 B/upvalue (vs TW's
  16 B `{Env*,Expr*}` with a shared Env); `ValuePair` 32 B (vs ~16 B). Bindings are
  actually *leaner* than TW. This tax buys v3's compute win (fib RSS 0.27× TW).
- **B — neither engine reclaims → peak ≈ cumulative bytes:** v3 allocates more
  garbage (bigger objects + 68.7 % of thunks never forced = churn TW never creates).
- **C — 224 MB stranded dead (44 % of firefox peak):** freed=0 blocks; the place v3
  *could* beat TW (TW's conservative GC can never reclaim mid-eval).

Consequence: a distributed tax yields **15–40 MB levers by construction** — the
−80 MB single-lever bar was mis-shaped and shelved a correct win (L1). **Switch to a
cumulative/stacking bar.**

## Concrete steps (ordered; each a todo FP-0..4)

### FP-0 — re-shape the bar (process; do first)
Replace the per-lever −80 MB threshold with a **cumulative RSS ratchet**: a
correct, byte-identical, CPU-neutral lever counts toward a per-release cumulative
target even if <40 MB. Add a `cumulative_rss` column to `bench/baselines/seven-rows.tsv`
+ a `make ratchet-check` note. Unblocks FP-1/2/3.

### FP-1 — un-gate L1 (now; cheap; already validated)
Flip `NIX_V3_CHAIN_LOOKUP_SELECT` default-on. **−33.6 MB firefox arena** (darwin-4
confirmed), byte-identical, CPU-neutral; validated (06-07 canary 5/5, lang 143, core
21/21 gate-on, provenance 0, aggressive-GC clean). Re-confirm byte-identity + core
after the default flip. ½ day. → banks −33 MB.

### FP-2 — thunk-header shrink 40 → 24 B (the M5 lever; ⚠ drv-hash + GC-critical)
Two stages; each removes 8 B from the suspended union. **Arena rounds allocs to
16 B** (`(bytes+15)&~15`, cell-bitmap depends on it), so removing 8 B changes the
*allocated* size only when it crosses a 16 B boundary: the full 16 B (40→24) gives
null-withs thunks a clean 16 B, but split into 8 B stages each helps half the
population by `nUp` parity.

**FP-2a — drop `suspended.cu` — SHIPPED (56968f897).** A suspended thunk's CU is
its descriptor's owning CU: OP_MAKE_THUNK is the SOLE creator (vm.cc:4773/4777 =
only `allocThunkSuspended` caller + only `suspended.desc=` writer) and sets
`desc=&cu->lambdas[i]`, so `desc->cu` is well-defined and equals the stored `cu`.
Added a transient (NOT-serialized) `mutable cu` backpointer to `LambdaDescriptor`,
set idempotently at MAKE; read via `thunkCU(t)`. Byte-identical by construction;
canary 5/5 + core 21/21 + `static_assert(sizeof(Thunk)==32)`. Header 40→32. NB:
ABI change → rebuild ALL v3 test binaries (a stale v3-smoke gave a false 20/21).
Arena unchanged on firefox (469.8) — banked the even-`nUp` half, masked by peak.

**FP-2b — relocate `capturedWiths` to the FAM tail — SHIPPED (8cd42314d).**
The reviewer's "gate on `nWithTargets>0`" was imprecise — the snapshot fallback
makes `capturedWiths` non-null whenever a `with` is active.  Measured the real
gate (V3_DBG_THUNK_WITHS, = `capturedWiths==null`): firefox 74.1 % of 2.05 M; M5
97.1 % of 17.1 M.  Design: removed `capturedWiths` from the union (→ `{desc}` =
8 B → header **24 B**, `static_assert==24`); store the `ListVec*` RAW at
`tail[nUpvalues]` iff `willHaveWiths = (nWiths>0) || (withStack > frame.base)`
(pre-alloc; EXACTLY predicts `capturedWiths!=null` since `snapshotCurrentWiths`
is null iff `top<=base`); bit in the spare `_pad0` → `hasWithsSlot`; accessors
`thunkCapturedWiths`/`thunkSetCapturedWiths` (getter gated on Suspended/Blackhole
so a stale bit on an evac-shrunk Evaluated thunk can't read OOB).  CRITICAL: one
source-of-truth `thunkScanSize()` replaces all ~15 size sites so the evac COPY
never drops the slot (= UAF); all reads/forwards updated (gc.cc:667/717 evac
forward = the UAF surface; mark_sweep, live_trace, barrier.hh; fakeClo ×2; MAKE ×3).

**Realized win (the M5 lever): M5 arena 2013.3 → 1862.3 MB (−151 MB, beats the
141 MB projection); COMBINED FP-1+FP-2a+FP-2b M5 = 2147.5 → 1862.3 = −285 MB.**
firefox 469.8 → 453.0 (−16.8; the `nUp=1` bucket crossed the 16 B boundary so its
peak moved after all).  Byte-identical: canary 5/5 + core 21/21 + firefox/M5
drvPath/name under major-GC AND hello/firefox/git.drvPath under `NIX_V3_NURSERY=1`
(validates the withs-slot scavenge forward).  `--brute` 21/22 — UNCHANGED vs the
pre-FP-2b baseline: BRUTE hits are the pre-existing PhD-6 family (hello-drvPath/
outPath, gcc-name) + a stale firefox golden (150.0.3 vs 151.0.4), none
withs-related → FP-2b added NO new missed root.  V3_DBG_THUNK_WITHS probe retired.

### FP-3 — pair tax (ValuePair 32 B) — INVESTIGATED; split stays RETIRED, tax is large but foundational
**Reconcile (the question this step posed): the 24/32 split was retired for a
THIRD reason neither anticipated — the 16 B alloc-rounding wall, NOT the
mis-shaped bar and NOT an aliasing hazard** (commit 38c263bdb): `alloc(24)` rounds
up to a full 32 B cell, byte-for-byte identical to `alloc(32)`, so the split saves
ZERO.  The FP-0 cumulative-bar reframe does **not** revive it — there is no byte to
bank.  (Contrast FP-2: the thunk removed *two* 8 B fields = a full 16 B granule, so
it crossed; the pair has only *one* removable field `third`, so 32→24 rounds back.)
**Stays retired.**

**Sizing (measured, live per-tag arena): the pair tax is LARGE — firefox 45.85 MB
(10.5 % of 436 MB), M5 253.52 MB (13.7 % of 1845 MB).**  So it is worth a future
foundational sprint, just not a cheap lever.  Two paths, both foundational:
- **8 B-granular allocator** (kAlign 16→8, double the cellStarts/cellTypes
  bitmaps): unlocks the original split (App = 24 B `{left,right,evaluated}`, drop
  only `third`) → ~8 B / 2-arg pair ≈ **~63 MB M5** / ~11 MB firefox.  Lower
  semantic risk (keeps the App memo) but a real allocator change; benefits other
  sub-16 B cases too.
- **ValuePair 32→16 B `{left,right}`** (drop BOTH `evaluated` AND `third` to cross
  the boundary): ~**127 MB M5** / ~23 MB firefox — but `evaluated` is the
  load-bearing App-result memo (vm.cc:12243; App self-memoization), so removing it
  needs the memo relocated (e.g. cell-update like thunks) — drv-hash-critical and
  the higher-risk path.

**Recommendation: keep the split retired; propose the pair tax as a FUTURE
foundational item (8 B-granular allocator preferred — lower risk), sequenced AFTER
FP-4** (the nursery is the bigger Layer-C win and shares no surface).  No code this
step — the reconcile + sizing is the deliverable (Rule 0: kills "FP-0 revives the
split").

#### FP-3 CLOSURE (2026-06-20 — M5 now measurable on darwin-4; lever CLOSED, not built)
The 2026-06-14 sizing used the PRE-colleague-stack arena.  Re-measured on darwin-4
(quiet host) at HEAD `81b58dc66` (env-sharing+interning+mapAttrs stack default-on),
with the major GC forced near each workload's peak arena (`NIX_V3_MAJOR_GC_THRESHOLD_MB`
just under peak) to read **peak-LIVE** pairs (not allocated churn — the FP-2 measure-
first lesson):

| workload | peak arena | peak-LIVE pairs | ×32 B (live) | allocated pairs (incl nursery) |
|----------|-----------:|----------------:|-------------:|-------------------------------:|
| firefox  | 436 MB     | 493 516         | 15.8 MB      | 33.5 MB (was 45.85 pre-stack)  |
| M5       | 1543 MB    | 1 586 803       | 50.8 MB      | 125.4 MB (was 253.52 pre-stack)|

Three measurement-driven findings retire BOTH paths:

1. **The colleague's mapAttrs App3-deferral already captured ~half the pair tax.**
   Allocated pairs M5 253.52 → **125.4 MB**, firefox 45.85 → **33.5 MB**.  The FP-3
   projections (63 MB a / 127 MB M5 b) were against the larger pre-stack population;
   the residual headroom is now ~half.

2. **Option (a) 8 B-granular allocator (kAlign 16→8) is marginal-to-net-loss, not the
   "lower-risk win" FP-3 assumed.**  Doubling the granule doubles `cellTypes` (1 byte/
   granule) + `cellStarts` (1 bit/granule): the metadata INCREMENT is `arena/16`
   (≈ **96 MB on M5**) + `arena/128` bits.  The rounding win is `8 B × (live cells whose
   size mod 16 ∈ [1,8])` ≤ 8 B × (a fraction of M5's 15.1 M live cells) ≈ 40–60 MB.
   Net = win − metadata ≈ break-even-to-negative; the sign hinges on M5's avg live-cell
   size (~64–103 B, right at the cross-over `avg<64 ⇒ win`).  A heap-wide allocator +
   GC-walker change (the campaign's highest *allocator* risk) for an uncertain ≤~0
   net is not justified.

3. **Option (b) ValuePair 32→16 B `{left,right}` is a real but small win at the highest
   *semantic* risk.**  Peak-live win ≈ 50.8 MB ÷ 2 = **~25 MB M5** / ~8 MB firefox
   (≤ ~2 % of M5 RSS; the allocated ceiling ~62 MB is mostly nursery churn that never
   reaches peak tenured).  Surface is smaller than feared — `ValuePair.evaluated`
   (the App self-memo) is only **6 real sites, 2 load-bearing short-circuits**
   (vm.cc:8422 / 13791) — but dropping it without relocating the memo re-evaluates hot
   Apps (**the #696 class**: re-eval every dispatch on hot mapAttrs entries → a CPU
   regression that would fail the ≤3 % darwin-4 bar).  Relocating it (App cell-update,
   like thunks) is drv-hash-critical.  App3's `third` (~80 real sites; App3 is now
   *common* post-mapAttrs-deferral) must also go → nested App (2×16 B), which OFFSETS
   the win for the App3 fraction.

**DECISION: pair tax CLOSED (not built).** Both paths are at-best-small wins (≤ ~2 %
RSS) at high risk, below the project's risk/reward bar (Rule 0 + the byte-id oracle +
the ≤3 % CPU bar).  The colleague's mapAttrs stack already banked the cheap half.
The thunk-header lever (FP-2, the bigger M5 win at −285 MB) remains the realized
structural memory win; the next *strategic* RSS lever is the nursery/gen-major
Layer-C reclaim (FP-4, shipped), not per-object shrink.  If a future workload makes
the residual ~25 MB worth the App-cell-update risk, option (b) is the path (option (a)
is retired as metadata-negative).

### FP-4 — generational nursery (the strategic Layer-C lever; multi-week; ⚠)
The ONLY path to beating TW on derivations (reclaim the 224 MB dead mid-eval — the
one capability TW's conservative GC structurally forbids). The barriers are already
correct (8 workloads byte-identical + AR7 stress) and the nursery is a measured
**−19/−53/−42 % CPU win** on firefox/HNE/M5. Blocked on:
- **PhD-6** — RCA+fix the one missed root (`--brute`: 41 tenured words → 1 shared
  nursery obj on hello). Careful GC-scavenger work (a wrong walker = UAF). Teach the
  brute scanner to type holders without the major-GC cell-start bitmap (off under the
  nursery), find the unbarriered write / missing per-type walk, fix, re-run → 0 hits.
- then full byte-identity → flip nursery default-on (5-gate) → **completes Phase D
  AND workstream E**.

## Stacking projection (the point of the new bar)
firefox: L1 (−33) + header (−16 live) + pair (−16) ≈ **−60–90 MB** of the live tax;
nursery then attacks the **224 MB dead**. M5: header alone ~**−78 MB live / −272 MB
churn**. Each is byte-identical + (mostly) CPU-neutral-or-positive.

## Honest stakeholder framing (the reviewer's, endorsed)
v3 pays memory to buy CPU and is already far ahead on compute (fib 0.27× RSS). On
derivations the live tax stacks down to ~1.5×; *beating* TW there requires turning
v3's GC weakness (no mid-eval reclaim) into the advantage TW can never have — the
generational nursery (FP-4). Stop hunting for a fourth cheap firefox lever; the
measurements say there isn't one.

## Sequencing
FP-0 → FP-1 (this session, safe) → FP-2 (1 wk, the M5 win) → FP-3 (investigate) →
FP-4 (multi-week, the firefox endgame; completes Phase D + E). Standing gates:
cumulative ratchet, full byte-identity for ⚠ levers, the brute scanner for any GC
change, Rule 0.
