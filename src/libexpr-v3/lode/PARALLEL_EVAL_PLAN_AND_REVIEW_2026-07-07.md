# Parallel eval for v3 — GC verdict, phased plan, hard-parts review, go/no-go (2026-07-07)

**Status: DESIGN / CRITICAL REVIEW. No code, no build.** Supersedes the pessimism
of `PARALLEL_EVAL_CAPABILITIES_2026-05-18.md` §5 (per-workload table) and closes
its §8 measurement-spike loop with the now-shipped trace data. Grounds every claim
in file:line + the `NIX_V3_PAR_TRACE` numbers (git-noted at `aac10b894`) + the
Determinate/Lix prior art.

## 0. TL;DR

- **GC verdict (headline): Option A is viable — and it is the RIGHT answer.** v3 can
  run parallel *mutators* with a **stop-the-world moving collector at a global
  safepoint** and per-thread nurseries, WITHOUT a concurrent/parallel moving GC.
  This is exactly how default-parallel GHC and JVM young-gen work: parallel
  mutators + STW copying collector. **Effort ≈ 4-7 months** (Determinate-shaped,
  our moving GC *parked* at the safepoint), **not** the 9-15 months a concurrent
  moving GC (Option B) would cost. Option B is a latency technique v3 does not need.
- **Why Option A works for v3 specifically:** the collector already fires ONLY at
  `exitDepth == 0` (vm.cc:4482-4560) — a *natural* safepoint — and the nursery,
  arena, dirty-list, and active-VMState registry are ALREADY `thread_local`
  (nursery.hh:686, alloc.hh:2871, barrier.cc:39, vm.cc:3777). The single-threaded
  design is, by accident of the moving-GC discipline, already shaped for the
  parallel extension. The hard new work is a *global* rendezvous + walking N
  C-stacks + N active-VMState registries at the STW point.
- **Phased MVP:** (P0 refactor thread-through) → **P1 atomic thunk state**
  (Suspended/**Pending**/**Awaited**/Blackhole/Evaluated/**Failed** + CAS + waiter
  list, à la Determinate) → **P2 lock-free symbol intern** → **P3 per-thread
  nurseries + global STW safepoint** (the moving-GC crux) → **P4 thread-safe
  caches** (ImportCache/AppliedCache/disk) + **FFI serialization** → **P5
  `parallelMap`/spark on the 1.7k-16.8k independent root forces** → **P6
  work-stealing**. Each phase has a pre-committed speedup gate.
- **Honest go/no-go: CONDITIONAL / DEFER.** Parallelism buys ~**3-4× wall-clock**
  (matching the ecosystem's measured ceiling — Determinate 4.1×/12t flake-show,
  3.0×/16t search) but is **ORTHOGONAL** to the two beat-TW walls (per-op 1.5-2.2×,
  RSS 1.6-2×) and to the moat. The DAG is wide+shallow (NOT Amdahl-dead: op-weighted
  W/S = 17.9× hello / 24.5× git / 46.6× M5) but **~50% of forces are memo-hits**
  (serialized-by-reuse) → the same sub-linear ceiling Determinate hit. And the
  **1.7k-16.8k independent root forces mean process-level parallelism
  (nix-eval-jobs / Hydra / `xargs -P`) already captures the throughput for free**.
  **Recommend: do NOT commit the full stack now.** Parallel eval is worth it ONLY if
  **single-eval LATENCY** (one big `nix eval`/`nixos-rebuild`/repl, un-splittable
  into processes) or a **long-lived daemon** becomes the pinned objective. If it
  does, do P1+P2 first (they are independently useful and low-risk), gate on P5.
  Otherwise the cheaper `PARALLEL_EVAL_CAPABILITIES` §6 alternatives (I/O
  concurrency ~4-8wk; speculative pre-forcing ~2-4wk) capture the realistic
  single-eval latency win at a fraction of the risk.

## 1. THE GC VERDICT (headline) — Option A vs Option B

### 1.1 The question, precisely

Determinate and Lix get 3-4× on cppnix WITHOUT touching the GC because Boehm is
already thread-aware (mark-sweep, non-moving, stop-the-world on heap pressure —
nesting-independent). v3's blocker is that its collector **MOVES** cells (Cheney
scavenge nursery→tenured with a forwarding map, gc.cc:85 `unordered_map<void*,
void*> forward`; Immix evacuation in the tenured region). You cannot relocate a
cell while another thread holds a raw `nix::Value*`/`Thunk*`/`Closure*` to it —
that is the PhD-6 root class, now multi-threaded.

Two ways out:

- **Option A — moving GC stays, STW at a global safepoint + per-thread nurseries.**
  All mutator threads run in parallel; when GC is needed they *all* rendezvous at a
  safepoint, one (or several cooperating) thread does the existing moving
  scavenge/major collection while the others are *parked*, then everyone resumes.
  Mutators are parallel; the collector is stop-the-world (it may itself be
  parallel-but-still-STW later). This is default GHC (`-threaded` copying GC: "when
  a GC is required, all the cores stop running Haskell code and report for GC
  duties") and JVM young-gen.
- **Option B — concurrent/parallel *moving* GC.** Collector relocates cells
  *concurrently* with mutation. Needs read/write barriers that cooperate with
  moving (Brooks/Baker forwarding, or a SATB/load-barrier à la ZGC/Shenandoah).
  This is the 9-15mo, Layer-5, very-high-risk path.

### 1.2 Verdict: **Option A. Option B is not required.**

**Option B is a LATENCY technique, and v3 does not have a latency problem it
solves.** Concurrent moving GC exists to shrink *pause times* for interactive/
real-time workloads (GHC's `--nonmoving-gc` is explicitly "low-latency" and costs
~10% throughput — LITERATURE_SWEEP §"myth-busts"). Nix eval is a *batch* workload:
we care about total wall-clock, not p99 pause. A STW pause that parks 8 threads for
the duration of a scavenge is *throughput-neutral* as long as GC is a small % of
runtime — and the profile says it is: **GC ≤ 7% on-CPU** across firefox/HNE/M5
(project memory PROFILE_AT_SCALE 2026-06-21). Paying 9-15mo + the historically-
worst class of VM bugs (concurrent heap walks) to shrink a ≤7% STW slice is
disproportionate. **Option A captures essentially all of the parallel-mutator win.**

**Option A is viable for v3 because the architecture is already 80% shaped for it:**

| Requirement for Option A | v3 today | Citation |
|---|---|---|
| A place where GC can safely fire (no raw ptrs mid-relocation) | GC fires ONLY at `exitDepth == 0` — the outermost dispatch boundary; inner dispatch loops are explicitly forbidden from scavenging | vm.cc:4482-4493 (nursery gate), 4514-4530 (scavenge), 4545-4560 (major) |
| Per-thread bump allocation (no alloc contention) | Nursery is `thread_local Nursery` already | nursery.hh:686 |
| Per-thread tenured arena | `thread_local Arena` already | alloc.hh:2871 |
| Per-thread remembered set / dirty list | `thread_local tl_dirty`, `tl_standaloneCells` | barrier.cc:39, 41 |
| A per-thread registry of live VMStates the collector must walk | `thread_local tlActiveVMStack` — added in #705 to solve the *nested-VMState* missed-root problem WITHIN a thread | vm.cc:3777 |
| Conservative C-stack scan to find raw ptrs in C locals | `walkCStackConservative()` via setjmp + platform stack-base | mark_sweep.cc:848-952 |
| Precise root walk of VM stacks | `walkAllV3Roots()` enumerates `activeVMStack()` | precise_root.cc:100; vm.cc:4636 |

The `exitDepth == 0` gate is the single most important fact: **v3 already has a
safepoint.** The single-thread rationale (vm.cc:4483-4495) is *exactly* the
multi-thread rationale — "inner dispatch loops hold nursery pointers in C-stack
locals; scavenging there would relocate objects leaving callers' locals stale." In
the parallel world this generalizes to: **each worker parks at its own
`exitDepth==0`; the collector runs when ALL workers are parked.** And
`tlActiveVMStack` (vm.cc:3777, "the scavenger walks ALL entries here so every
VMState on the call chain has its roots forwarded") is *precisely* the mechanism
that generalizes to "the STW collector walks every worker's active-VMState stack."
The nested-force problem #705 already solved single-threaded is the same shape as
the multi-thread root-enumeration problem.

### 1.3 What Option A still costs (the honest delta)

Option A is NOT free — it is "months, Determinate-shaped, GC parked," which is the
whole point of getting the verdict right. The genuinely-new work vs
single-threaded:

1. **Global rendezvous ("safepoint request").** Today `exitDepth==0` is a
   *local* condition per dispatch loop. Parallel needs a global "GC pending" flag
   that each worker polls at its `exitDepth==0` boundary (cheap: fold into the
   existing slow-gate mask the dispatch loop already checks — the same mask
   `opTick` folds into, par_trace.cc). A worker that reaches the boundary with the
   flag set blocks on a barrier; the last arriver runs GC; a generation counter
   releases the rest. **This is the classic "safepoint poll" and is well-trodden.**
2. **Walk N C-stacks + N active-VMState registries at the STW point.** Today the
   collector scans one thread's C-stack (mark_sweep.cc:848) and one thread's
   `tlActiveVMStack`. Parallel needs a *global registry of worker
   {C-stack-bounds, active-VMState-stack, nursery, dirty-list}* that the STW
   collector iterates. Each worker registers on spawn; the collector, once all are
   parked, scans each. This is mechanical but touches the root-enumeration core.
3. **Per-thread forwarding maps → one moving cell has one forwarder.** Cheney
   forwarding (gc.cc:85) is per-thread today (`threadScavengeBuffers()`, gc.cc:97).
   A cell tenured by thread A but referenced by thread B must be forwarded *once*
   and both see the new address. Under STW this is fine IF the collector treats the
   union of all thread heaps as one graph (single forwarding map for the STW
   cycle). This is the main *design* subtlety, not a barrier: STW means no mutator
   races the forward, so a single collector-owned forwarding map suffices.
4. **`g_singletonCapturedWithsRegistry` is process-global and UNGUARDED**
   (barrier.cc:56). Under threads this is a data race. Fix: make it thread-local
   like its siblings, or lock it. Small but must-fix (a UAF/corruption hazard).
5. **Parked-worker C-stack liveness.** A parked worker's C-stack still holds live
   roots (it's mid-eval). The barrier must guarantee a parked worker's stack is
   *quiescent* (not being written) when scanned — which parking at a safepoint
   gives you by construction. This is the JVM "all threads at safepoint" invariant.

**Effort estimate, Option A:** P0-P4 below ≈ **4-7 months** including race-bug
debugging (the perennial multiplier). This is *materially cheaper* than the prior
doc's 9-15mo because that estimate carried Layer-5 parallel GC (6-8wk) AND the
implicit assumption of concurrent collection. Parking the *existing* moving
collector at a *global* version of the *existing* `exitDepth==0` safepoint removes
the single largest and riskiest line item.

**Effort delta A→B:** +8-12mo and the highest-risk code in any runtime (concurrent
moving heap walk with mutator barriers). **Not justified** for a ≤7%-GC batch
evaluator. Option B is bookmarked, not planned.

---

## 2. MINIMUM-VIABLE-PARALLELISM — phased plan (files + gates)

Dependency-ordered. Each phase is independently shippable behind
`NIX_V3_EVAL_CORES` (default 1 = today's exact single-threaded path; N>1 opts in),
independently measurable, and carries a pre-committed speedup/regression gate.
Rule-0: a phase that fails its gate is reverted or its hypothesis killed, not left
as a coexisting opt-in.

**Correctness spine for every phase:** full `--brute` (22 suites) MUST stay green
at `EVAL_CORES=1` (byte-identical to today) AND at `EVAL_CORES=N` (drvPath
byte-identical to the N=1 golden). Multi-threading determinism is the gate that
catches races; drv-parity is the gate that catches divergence.

### P0 — Thread-through refactor (prereq; no behavior change)

Make the single global evaluator state explicitly per-worker. `VMState`
(vm.hh:127-170) is *already* a self-contained struct (valueStack/frames/withStack +
the LEVER-1 applied-cache fields) — the good news is this is mostly done. The work
is auditing the remaining `g_*` process-globals and static locals the dispatch/
alloc/GC path touches (the GC agent enumerated them) and confirming each is either
(a) already `thread_local`, (b) read-only-after-init (fine to share), or (c) needs
guarding. **Files:** vm.cc (dispatch), vm.hh (VMState), barrier.cc (the one
unguarded `g_singletonCapturedWithsRegistry`:56 → thread-local). **Gate:** N=1
byte-identical, `--brute` 22/22, zero perf delta. **Risk:** Low. **~3-4 wk.**

### P1 — Atomic thunk state machine (the Determinate core)

This is the heart, and v3's starting point is *cleaner* than the prior doc feared.

- **Today:** `enum class ThunkState : uint8_t { Suspended, Blackhole, Evaluated,
  Native }` (closure.hh:126-132) — a **plain byte**, no atomics. Transition sites:
  Suspended→Blackhole at vm.cc:9860 (before pushing the body frame); Blackhole→
  Evaluated at vm.cc:9055-9056 (`thunkSetEvaluated` writes the 8-byte result
  `evaluated` field FIRST, then the state). **The payload-before-tag discipline
  Determinate requires ALREADY HOLDS by luck** (barrier.hh:308-316). Blackhole
  cycle detection throws `BlackholeError` at vm.cc:15235.
- **Change (à la Determinate `parallel-nix-eval`):** make `state`
  `std::atomic<uint8_t>`; add **Pending** (being evaluated, no waiters), **Awaited**
  (being evaluated, ≥1 waiter), **Failed** (threw; payload = `std::exception_ptr`).
  Force protocol:
  - `Suspended --CAS--> Pending` (winner evaluates; only one thread wins).
  - Forcing a `Pending`: `Pending --CAS--> Awaited`, register self in a waiter list
    *stored separately from the cell* (Determinate keeps waiters off the value so
    the value stays 8 bytes and unmoved-by-waiters), then block.
  - Winner on completion: write `evaluated` payload, then atomic store `Evaluated`
    with release ordering (the discipline v3 already follows), then wake waiters.
  - Winner on exception: store `Failed` + `exception_ptr`, wake waiters (they
    rethrow).
- **Result fits one atomic word:** v3's `evaluated` is a single 8-byte NaN-boxed
  `Value` (closure.hh:214, value.hh:120-122 `sizeof(Value)==8`) — so, unlike the
  prior doc's worry about 16-byte results needing cmpxchg16b, **v3 needs only an
  8-byte payload store + a 1-byte atomic state swap.** The tag also lives *inside*
  the NaN-box word (value.hh:124-131), so the "make the type field atomic" move maps
  onto v3 as "make the `ThunkState state` byte atomic" — even simpler than making
  the whole Value atomic.
- **Cross-thread cycle detection:** the single-thread Blackhole==self-cycle
  invariant breaks. A `Pending`/`Awaited` owned by *another* thread is NOT a cycle
  — you wait. A cycle is now a *cycle in the waiter graph* (A waits on B waits on
  A). Need deadlock detection over the waiter edges (Determinate has "a couple of
  concurrency bugs to sort out" here — this is a known-hard corner). v3's existing
  cross-VM `Value::vBlackhole` sentinel path (vm.cc:15163) is the seed of the
  waiter-propagation mechanism.
- **Files:** closure.hh (state field + states), barrier.hh (thunkSetEvaluated
  ordering — already right), vm.cc (9860 force entry → CAS; 9055 completion → store
  + wake; 15163/15235 blackhole → waiter-graph). New: a waiter-list side table.
- **Gate:** `--brute` 22/22 at N=1 AND N=8 (races surface here first); drvPath
  byte-id N=8==N=1. No speedup gate yet (single-threaded scheduling in P1 — just
  correctness of the atomic protocol). **Risk: HIGH** (memory ordering + waiter
  deadlock). **~4-6 wk.**

### P2 — Lock-free (or sharded) symbol / string interning

- **Today:** `GlobalSymTab { std::vector<std::string> table;
  std::unordered_map<std::string,SymbolId> index; }` (ir.cc:48-82), accessed via
  `globalInternSymbol` (ir.cc:88-100) — **zero synchronization, append-only.**
  Exactly Determinate's pre-lock-free starting point ("the symbol table was
  rewritten to make symbol access lock-free").
- **Change:** append-only + CAS on the index (a symbol, once interned, never
  changes id → readers are lock-free; only insert contends). A sharded mutex or a
  concurrent hash map (the codebase already links a concurrent-map dependency —
  primops.cc:103) is the low-risk first cut; lock-free is the optimization.
- **Files:** ir.cc (GlobalSymTab). **Gate:** N=8 `--brute` green + no measurable
  intern contention in a symbol-heavy eval (flake-show). **Risk: Medium.** **~2 wk.**

### P3 — Per-thread nurseries + global STW safepoint (the moving-GC crux)

The Option-A payload. Nursery/arena/dirty-list are already `thread_local` (P-nothing
needed there). The new work is §1.3 items 1-3+5:
- Global "GC-pending" flag polled at each worker's `exitDepth==0` (fold into the
  existing dispatch slow-gate mask, vm.cc:4482 region).
- Global worker registry {C-stack bounds, `tlActiveVMStack`, nursery, dirty-list}.
- STW barrier: last-arriver runs the *existing* moving scavenge/major (gc.cc,
  mark_sweep.cc) over the union of worker heaps with one collector-owned forwarding
  map; generation counter releases parked workers.
- Fix `g_singletonCapturedWithsRegistry` (barrier.cc:56) race (if not already in
  P0).
- **Files:** vm.cc (safepoint poll + barrier + worker registry), gc.cc (multi-root
  scavenge over registry), mark_sweep.cc (multi-C-stack scan — generalize
  `walkCStackConservative` to iterate the registry), barrier.cc, nursery.hh.
- **Gate:** N=8 `--brute` 22/22 under the aggressive 1MB-nursery brute stress (this
  is where a missed cross-thread root shows up as a UAF); drvPath byte-id; GC STW
  pause ≤ (single-thread GC time × small constant) so throughput stays ≥ linear-ish.
  **Risk: VERY HIGH** (the moving-GC-under-threads correctness core — but bounded by
  STW, which removes the concurrent-heap-walk class). **~6-10 wk.**

### P4 — Thread-safe caches + FFI serialization

- **Caches (unguarded plain maps today):** ImportCache (primops.cc:6463-6540, ~700
  MB burden, `unordered_map` + `deque<CompilationUnit>` with LRU eviction),
  AppliedCache (primops.cc:6765-6789 — **the LEVER-1 moat**), disk cache
  (disk_cache.cc; SQLite already has an init mutex, aot_cache.cc:38-45). Need
  thread-safe insert + lookup. **Design subtlety:** LRU eviction mutates on *read*
  (`bumpImportEntry`, accessCounter++) → a naive shared-map + eviction is a
  write-on-read contention hotspot. Options: sharded caches, or read-mostly with
  epoch-based reclamation, or per-worker cache with a merge at safepoint. The
  AppliedCache moat is small (8 entries default) → a single mutex is fine; the
  ImportCache is the contention risk.
- **FFI (the serialization point, and the M5 question):** ~1015 LoC FFI infra, 104
  static TW-cross sites, 59 ffi.hh wrappers (FFI_AUDIT_2026-05-20; ffi.cc). cppnix's
  `EvalState`/libstore/Boehm are NOT thread-safe. Start with a **global FFI mutex**
  (prior doc §6, Determinate-agnostic): any worker entering TW (import/IFD via
  `realisePath` ffi.cc:172, `derivationStrict`, fetchers ffi.cc:629-693,
  `addPathFull`/`filterSource` ffi.cc:518-620, readFile/readDir, `getFlake`
  ffi.cc:868, `outputOf` ffi.cc:828) takes the lock. Migrate to per-API locks or a
  designated-TW-thread only if contention shows.
- **HOW MUCH OF M5 IS FFI-BOUND (must measure before trusting M5 speedup):** M5 is
  IFD-heavy (project memory: "M5 IS IFD, x86_64 plan-to-nix ~33s one-time"). If the
  serialized IFD/store fraction is large, the FFI mutex caps M5's parallel win hard
  — this is the Amdahl term that isn't in the pure-eval trace (the trace is
  idealized, ignores FFI serialization, par_trace.hh explicitly). **A per-workload
  "FFI on-CPU + wall-in-TW" measurement is the P4 pre-gate.**
- **Files:** primops.cc (caches), ffi.cc/ffi.hh (mutex), disk_cache.cc. **Gate:** N=8
  green + cache/FFI contention not eating the P5 speedup. **Risk: HIGH** (FFI
  thread-safety of cppnix "in unexpected ways" — prior doc §6). **~3-4 wk + debug.**

### P5 — `parallelMap` / spark on the independent root forces (the payoff phase)

The fan-out unit is *measured*: **1.7k-16.8k mutually-independent top-level root
forces** per eval (par_trace.cc:73-79 `g_rootForces`, "top-level, independent";
git-noted `aac10b894`). A drvPath eval is driven by top-level bytecode launching
many independent root forces — the obvious embarrassingly-parallel fan-out. Also the
canonical `mkDerivation { buildInputs = [a b c]; }` shape (prior doc §3 option c).
- **Design:** a `parallelForce`/spark that hands independent root forces (or
  buildInputs lists) to a worker pool; sparks are hints (idle worker steals, else
  dropped — GHC model). Strictness-analysis-driven sparking (prior doc §3 option b)
  is the principled version but needs Stage 4; the *pragmatic first cut* is
  pattern-matching the top-level root fan-out + `buildInputs`, which needs no
  strictness pass.
- **Files:** vm.cc (dispatch — spark creation at root-force sites + a worker pool),
  a new scheduler module. **Gate (THE speedup gate): ≥ 2.5× wall-clock on 8 cores**
  on flake-show / flake-check (the wide workloads) at byte-identical output. If <2×,
  the memo-sharing serialization (§3) has won and the whole stack is refuted →
  revert. **Risk: Medium** (scheduling correctness on top of P1-P4). **~3-4 wk.**

### P6 — Work-stealing deque (scale-out)

Chase-Lev lock-free deque (prior doc §12 refs). Only after P5 proves the ceiling is
worth chasing to higher core counts. **Files:** the P5 scheduler. **Gate:** improves
16-core scaling over P5's simpler pool. **Risk: Low** (well-documented). **~2 wk.**

**Cumulative Option-A MVP (P0-P5): ~4-7 months. P6 optional.**

## 3. RANKED HARD-PARTS / UAF REVIEW

Ranked by risk × likelihood-of-sinking-the-project.

### HP-1 [CRITICAL] Moving GC under threads — raw `Value*`/`Thunk*` in C locals across the safepoint (the PhD-6 class, now × N)
The whole reason Option A is non-trivial. A raw cell pointer in a *parked* worker's
C local must be found (conservative C-stack scan, mark_sweep.cc:848) and, because the
collector MOVES, *updated* via the forwarding map. Single-threaded v3 already lives
this (the `exitDepth==0` gate + `tlActiveVMStack` #705 exist *because* of it,
vm.cc:3777/4483). Multi-thread mitigation: STW parking guarantees each worker's stack
is quiescent when scanned (JVM safepoint invariant); one collector-owned forwarding
map per STW cycle removes mutator-vs-forward races. **The residual risk is the
worker registry being incomplete** — a live worker whose C-stack/VMState the
collector forgot to scan = the exact `tlActiveVMStack` missed-root UAF #705 fixed,
generalized cross-thread. Brute-stress (1MB nursery, N=8) is the detector.

### HP-2 [CRITICAL] FFI serialization + the M5 Amdahl term
cppnix TW/libstore/Boehm are not thread-safe. Every store-path/`derivationStrict`/
IFD/fetch call (104 cross-sites) serializes on the FFI lock. For IFD-bound M5 this
may cap the parallel win far below the idealized 46.6× W/S (the trace explicitly
ignores FFI serialization, par_trace.hh). **Must measure FFI wall-fraction per
workload before promising M5 numbers.** The V3-NATIVE constraint (fewer FFI
primops) directly reduces this contention — another reason V3-NATIVE matters.

### HP-3 [HIGH] The ~50% memo-sharing contention — shared thunks are CAS hotspots (this IS stdenv)
**~48-53% of all force-requests hit already-evaluated/shared thunks** (git-note
`aac10b894`; par_trace.cc:70 `g_memoHits`). Under parallel eval those shared thunks
(stdenv, lib, the fix-point) are exactly where every worker's CAS collides —
`Suspended→Pending` contention + waiter-list pile-ups on the hottest ~50% of forces.
This is *precisely* Determinate's measured sub-linearity: "most threads cannot make
progress until the `stdenv` value has been computed" → 3.0× on 16 threads for
search. **The memo-sharing that makes v3 fast single-threaded is the same thing that
caps its parallel scaling.** No fix — it's structural (the shared subgraph is shared
work). It sets the realistic ceiling at ~3-4×, not the idealized W/S.

### HP-4 [HIGH] Cross-thread blackhole / cycle detection & waiter-graph deadlock
Single-thread: Blackhole-on-self = cycle → `BlackholeError` (vm.cc:15235).
Multi-thread: a Pending/Awaited owned by *another* thread is a *wait*, not a cycle;
a real cycle is a cycle in the *waiter graph*. Need deadlock detection over waiter
edges without false-positiving on legitimate cross-thread waits. Determinate's own
"couple of concurrency bugs to sort out" live here. v3's cross-VM `Value::vBlackhole`
sentinel (vm.cc:15163) is the propagation seed. **Property test needed** (cycle
detection totality across threads — debug-story item #7, not yet built).

### HP-5 [MEDIUM] Thread-safe cache inserts with LRU-on-read
ImportCache/AppliedCache mutate on *read* (LRU bump: primops.cc:6500
`accessCounter++`, `bumpImportEntry`). A shared map with eviction is a
write-on-read contention point AND an eviction-vs-live-reference race (evicting an
entry a worker is mid-read = UAF). AppliedCache moat is tiny (8 entries) → one mutex.
ImportCache is the real one → sharding or per-worker + safepoint merge.

### HP-6 [MEDIUM] `g_singletonCapturedWithsRegistry` unguarded process-global
barrier.cc:56 — the one non-thread-local mutable GC registry. Straight data race
under threads. Must go thread-local or locked in P0. Small but a corruption class.

### HP-7 [LOW-MED] Determinism of drvPath under nondeterministic scheduling
The output must be byte-identical regardless of which worker forces what when. Nix
eval is pure, so results are scheduling-independent BY SEMANTICS — but any residual
order-dependence (error message ordering, trace interleaving, first-writer-wins in a
cache) is a divergence. The N=8==N=1 drvPath byte-id gate is the detector; it must
run in `--brute` at every phase.

---

## 4. HONEST GO / NO-GO

### 4.1 What parallelism is and isn't
- **Delivers:** ~**3-4× wall-clock** on wide workloads at 8-16 cores (matching the
  ecosystem: Determinate 4.1×/12t flake-show, 3.0×/16t search, 3.7× flake-check,
  5× the IFD test project; sub-linear by HP-3). The DAG is **NOT Amdahl-dead** (the
  prior doc's 1.2-2× table was too pessimistic — op-weighted W/S 17.9-46.6×; the
  width is there).
- **Does NOT touch the beat-TW walls.** Parallelism is orthogonal to per-op
  efficiency (1.5-2.2× wall, needs JIT) and RSS (1.6-2× — and parallel makes RSS
  *worse*: N nurseries + N worker heaps). It does not narrow the single-core gap to
  the tree-walker at all.
- **Does NOT extend the moat.** The repeated-eval result cache (LEVER-1, the actual
  strategic win) is a *cross-invocation* lever; parallelism is *intra-invocation*.
  Complementary at best, and parallel eval *complicates* the moat (thread-safe cache
  inserts, HP-5).

### 4.2 The process-parallelism problem (the decisive counter-argument)
The **1.7k-16.8k independent root forces** are also the reason intra-process
parallelism is *often unnecessary*: that same independence is what
**nix-eval-jobs / Hydra / `xargs -P` already exploit at the process level, at zero
v3 engineering cost and zero race risk.** For batch throughput (evaluate many
derivations/attrs/systems — the flake-show/flake-check/Hydra shapes where parallel
eval shines *most*), process-level parallelism captures the win *for free*. The
narrow residual case for *shared-memory* parallelism is:
- a **single big `nix eval`** that is one un-splittable expression with internal
  parallelism (a single `nixos-rebuild`/`nix build` eval, a repl), where **latency**
  (not throughput) is the objective and you cannot fork it into processes; OR
- a **long-lived daemon** amortizing warm state where duplicating that state across
  processes is wasteful (and even then, the moat + a shared cache may serve better).

### 4.3 Comparison to the cheaper §6 alternatives
For the single-eval-latency case, the prior doc's §6 alternatives are much cheaper
and race-free:
- **I/O concurrency (async, no parallel eval):** overlap readFile/readDir/fetch/
  store-query/IFD while eval continues. ~4-8wk, no atomic thunks, no parallel GC, no
  race class. Same FFI-thread-safety question (HP-2) but bounded. Captures a real
  slice of latency on I/O-heavy evals.
- **Speculative pre-forcing (single-threaded, scheduled):** eagerly force
  provably-strict positions (buildInputs) for cache locality. ~2-4wk post-Stage-4.
  Cap ~1.2-1.5×. No threads.

### 4.4 Recommendation
**DEFER the full stack. Do not commit P0-P6 now.** Rationale, in one line: parallel
eval buys ~3-4× wall-clock that is (a) orthogonal to both beat-TW walls and the
moat, (b) already free at the process level for the wide/batch workloads it helps
most, and (c) costs 4-7 months + the multi-threaded-race bug class, gated behind the
~50% memo-sharing ceiling and the FFI/M5 Amdahl term.

**Commit ONLY IF** a pinned objective appears that process-parallelism cannot serve:
**single-eval LATENCY** (one un-splittable big eval / interactive repl) or a
**shared-state daemon**. If it does:
1. **First, and independently useful even standalone:** P1 (atomic thunk state) +
   P2 (lock-free symbols). These are the Determinate core, they harden the thunk
   machine, and P2 removes a real single-thread hot-path allocation. Low-to-medium
   risk, ~6-8wk combined.
2. **Then measure the FFI/M5 Amdahl term (HP-2 pre-gate)** and the memo-contention
   (HP-3) on the *target* workload before P3-P5. If FFI wall-fraction is high on the
   target, stop — the ceiling is below 2×.
3. **P3-P5 only if the pre-gate clears.** P5's ≥2.5×/8-core gate is the final
   falsifier.

**Else (no latency/daemon objective): pursue the cheaper alternatives** — I/O
concurrency (§4.3) for I/O-bound latency, speculative pre-forcing for locality — and
keep steering throughput to process-level parallelism. **Retire `par_trace.cc` per
its own retirement criterion** (par_trace.hh §"Retirement criterion") — the
parallel-potential question is now decided by this doc.

## 4.6 Phase-0 measured ceiling (2026-07-07) — the Rule-0 gate, re-run + verdict

**Re-ran `NIX_V3_PAR_TRACE` at HEAD `b500141b7` (laptop; deterministic,
host-independent counters — the ratios are properties of the eval DAG, not the
host, so load does not affect them).** This is the explicit Rule-0 gate the
literature sweep named ("parallel-potential trace quantifies the ceiling"). It
confirms the `aac10b894` numbers and adds a fresh `firefox.drvPath` reference. All
runs: `nix eval --impure --no-eval-cache --option allow-import-from-derivation
true`, `NIX_V3_DIRECT_EVAL=1 NIX_V3_NO_DISK_CACHE=1`, flakes also
`NIX_V3_NO_NATIVE_CALL_FLAKE=1`, local nixpkgs.

### The ceiling table (op-weighted W/S is the load-bearing Amdahl input)

| Workload | root forces | work-forces | op-work | op-span (serial roots) | **op W/S serial-roots** (realistic ∞-core) | op W/S roots-parallel (optimistic) | deepest op-chain | **memo-hit** | peak nesting |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **firefox.drvPath** (ref, pure eval) | 156 | 1.44M | 33.3M | 941,984 | **35.3×** | 98.1× | 339,297 | **0.533** | 105 |
| **M5** cardano-node.name (IFD-heavy) | 16,752 | 11.12M | 234.6M | 5,038,535 | **46.6×** | 150.8× | 1,555,229 | **0.481** | 129 |
| hello.name (git-noted `aac10b894`) | — | — | — | — | 17.9× | — | — | 0.48–0.53 | — |
| git.drvPath (git-noted + re-confirmed) | — | 1.07M | 23.0M | 939,867 | 24.5× | 328× | 70,106 | 0.529 | 191 |
| python3 (git-noted `aac10b894`) | — | — | — | — | 17.7× | — | — | 0.48–0.53 | — |

- **COUNT-model ceilings are far higher** (firefox serial-roots 1767×, M5 167×;
  roots-parallel 13,718× / 86,240×) but the COUNT model gives every force self=1
  regardless of size, so it over-counts trivial leaves. **The op-weighted
  serial-roots column (35–47×) is the honest Amdahl ceiling** — it weights each
  force by the opcodes it actually dispatched, and treats the driver's top-level
  root forces as sequential (which they are in a single process).
- **HNE (`hello.drvPath`) and simplex (`exe:simplex-chat.name`) did NOT measure**
  on the current local checkouts: both are haskell.nix flakes whose local trees are
  stale on this host — HNE dies with `attribute 'array' missing` in the plan.nix
  module system (the documented compiler-nix-name/`flake update` drift), simplex
  with a `git-ls-files/files does not exist` IFD-source failure. Neither is a v3 or
  instrument fault; both are workload-tree environment breakage, out of scope for a
  Phase-0 measurement (fixing them would edit user workload trees). Their DAG *shape*
  is bracketed by the measured IFD flagship (M5) on one side and, per project memory,
  simplex is store/flake-bound (~10% JIT-addressable) — i.e. it would show the
  **lowest** parallel potential of the set (mostly serialized on FFI/store), which
  only strengthens the verdict below.

### What the numbers say (analysis)

1. **The DAG is wide+shallow — NOT Amdahl-dead.** Idealized op-weighted ceiling is
   **35–47×** on the two measured workloads (and 18–25× on the small git-noted
   ones). The deepest single dependency chain is tiny relative to the work
   (firefox 339K-op chain vs 33.3M op-work; M5 1.56M vs 234.6M) and force-stack
   nesting peaks at only 105–191. So the critical path is short; the width is real.
   There is genuine parallel structure to exploit.

2. **…but ~50% of every workload's forces are memo-hits (0.48–0.53), and that is
   the ceiling that bites.** This fraction is astonishingly stable across every
   workload measured (firefox 0.533, M5 0.481, git 0.529, hello/python3 0.48–0.53).
   These are forces that land on an already-`Evaluated` thunk — the shared subgraph
   (stdenv, lib, the fix-point) that memoization computes ONCE and reuses. Under
   parallel eval those shared thunks are exactly where every worker's
   `Suspended→Pending` CAS collides and waiter lists pile up. **The sharing that
   makes v3 fast single-threaded is the same sharing that serializes it in
   parallel** — this is precisely why Determinate measured *sub-linear* 3.0×/16t
   (search) and 4.1×/12t (flake-show) despite far-higher idealized ceilings. The
   idealized 35–47× is not achievable; the memo-serialized realistic ceiling is
   **~3–4× at 8–16 cores**, matching the ecosystem.

3. **The idealized ceiling ignores the three real taxes** (the trace says so in its
   own header): synchronization, the GC lock, and FFI serialization. Fold those in:
   - **Moving-GC synchronization tax:** the always-on scavenger/major collector
     MOVES cells with a per-thread forwarding map (gc.cc:85). Option A parks all
     workers at a *global* version of the existing `exitDepth==0` safepoint
     (vm.cc:4482) and runs the existing STW moving collect — throughput-neutral only
     while GC stays a small % of runtime. It is (≤7% on-CPU, project memory
     PROFILE_AT_SCALE). BUT: the barrier/repr campaign already measured what
     touching this layer costs — the `-DNIX_V3_NONMOVING_TENURED` Phase-S A/B (git
     note `e6f8ee33c`) showed the moving-GC's barrier+reclaim machinery is worth
     **+5.4% (firefox) / +10.4% (M5)** CPU *single-threaded*; a global STW rendezvous
     + N-C-stack/N-VMState root walk + one-forwarding-map-per-cycle adds rendezvous
     latency and serializes all N workers for the collect. On a ≤7%-GC batch
     evaluator this is affordable (Option A, not Option B), but it is a real slice
     off the top of the 3–4×, not free.
   - **FFI serialization (the M5 term):** every store/IFD/fetch call routes through
     `nix::EvalState`/libstore/Boehm (ffi.cc: `realisePath`:172, `outputOf`:828,
     `getFlake`:868), which are NOT thread-safe → a global FFI mutex. M5 is
     IFD-heavy (its 16,752 roots are driven through plan-to-nix IFD builds; the trace
     ignores the seconds spent *in* the serialized IFD sub-eval + store). For M5/HNE/
     simplex the serialized IFD/store fraction caps the parallel win well below the
     46.6× idealized number — and the store-level parallelism that DOES exist is
     already exploited by the daemon's build scheduler, not the evaluator.

4. **Granularity — are the parallel units big enough?** Yes for the fan-out unit,
   marginal for the tail. The natural spark unit is the **top-level independent root
   force**: firefox 156, M5 16,752. M5's roots are coarse (234.6M op-work / 16,752 ≈
   14K ops each on average — well above spark/scheduler overhead). firefox's 156
   roots are very coarse (213K ops each). So the *headline* fan-out amortizes
   scheduling fine. The risk is the long tail of tiny forces inside each root
   (work-forces ≫ root-forces: 11.1M vs 16.7K on M5) — sparking those is finer than
   spark+GC-sync overhead can amortize, so P5 must spark at the root/`buildInputs`
   grain, not per-thunk. The measured shape supports root-grain sparking.

### Verdict: **DEFER** (unchanged, now measurement-backed)

The re-run does not overturn §4.4 — it hardens it. Precisely:

- **Ceiling is real but capped:** idealized 35–47× (op-weighted) collapses to a
  **realistic ~3–4× at 8–16 cores** because of the **structural ~50% memo-hit
  serialization** (0.48–0.53, dead-stable across all five workloads) — exactly the
  Determinate ceiling. Not Amdahl-dead, but not the idealized number either.
- **GC tax is affordable but non-zero:** Option A (STW moving collect at a global
  `exitDepth==0` safepoint) is the right, cheaper path (the architecture is ~80%
  shaped for it — thread-local nursery/arena/dirty-list all confirmed present, the
  safepoint already exists); it does NOT eat the whole ceiling. But it is 4–7 months
  + the multi-threaded-race bug class, and it shaves a real slice (the STW
  rendezvous + the already-measured +5–10% GC-machinery cost) off the 3–4×.
- **Option A too expensive relative to the orthogonality:** the 3–4× is orthogonal
  to BOTH beat-TW walls (per-op 1.5–2.2×, RSS 1.6–2× — and N nurseries make RSS
  *worse*) and to the moat, AND is **already free at the process level** for the
  wide/batch workloads it helps most (the 156–16,752 independent roots are exactly
  what nix-eval-jobs / Hydra / `xargs -P` fan out today at zero v3 cost, zero race
  risk).

**GO/NO-GO = DEFER the full P0–P6 stack.** **CONDITIONAL** only on the appearance of
a pinned objective process-parallelism cannot serve — **single-eval LATENCY** (one
un-splittable big `nix eval`/`nixos-rebuild`/repl) or a **shared-state daemon**. If
that objective lands: do **P1 (atomic thunk state) + P2 (lock-free symbols)** first
(independently useful, hardens the thunk machine, ~6–8wk), then gate P3–P5 on a
per-workload **FFI-wall-fraction pre-measurement** (HP-2) and the memo-contention
(HP-3) on the *target* workload; P5's ≥2.5×/8-core gate is the final falsifier.
Otherwise pursue the cheaper `PARALLEL_EVAL_CAPABILITIES §6` alternatives (I/O
concurrency ~4–8wk; speculative pre-forcing ~2–4wk) and steer throughput to
process-level parallelism.

**`par_trace.cc` retirement:** its retirement criterion (par_trace.hh §"Retirement
criterion") is "delete once the parallel-eval GO/NO-GO is decided." This Phase-0
gate decides it (DEFER). The instrument MAY now be retired per Rule 0; keep it only
if the CONDITIONAL objective above is expected imminently (it is the HP-2/HP-3
pre-gate instrument).

**Git-note-worthy numbers (HEAD `b500141b7`, laptop, deterministic; re-confirms
`aac10b894`):** Phase-0 parallel-potential ceiling — op-weighted serial-roots W/S
**firefox.drvPath 35.3× / M5 cardano-node.name 46.6×** (re-confirmed) / git 24.5× /
hello 17.9× / python3 17.7×; **memo-hit 0.48–0.53 dead-stable across all** (firefox
0.533, M5 0.481, git 0.529); root forces firefox 156 / M5 16,752; deepest op-chain
firefox 339K / M5 1.56M (≪ op-work 33.3M / 234.6M → wide+shallow); peak nesting
105–129. HNE + simplex un-measurable (stale haskell.nix local checkouts:
`array missing` / `git-ls-files` IFD — not a v3 fault). VERDICT = **DEFER**: real
35–47× idealized ceiling collapses to ~3–4×/8–16c on the structural ~50% memo-sharing
serialization (= Determinate's measured ceiling); orthogonal to both beat-TW walls +
the moat; already free at the process level for the wide roots; Option A = 4–7mo +
race-bug class + a non-zero STW-GC tax. CONDITIONAL only on a single-eval-latency /
daemon objective (then P1+P2 first, FFI-wall pre-gate before P3–P5).
