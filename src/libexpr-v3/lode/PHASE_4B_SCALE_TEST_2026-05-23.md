# Phase 4b scale test — decisive measurement, 2026-05-23

> **SUPERSEDED 2026-05-27**: Post-RCA scale test supersedes (adds RCA + scope-bug fix + wall-positive). See [`PHASE_4B_SCALE_TEST_2026-05-24.md`](PHASE_4B_SCALE_TEST_2026-05-24.md). Preserved here for historical reference + back-link integrity.

After `b248b0f8d` landed Phase 4b (forceDeep at import-exit + serialise
for cross-process replay), this doc records the scale test on a
**10000-attr synthetic IFD workload** to determine whether wall
savings emerge at higher scale.

**Outcome**: even at 10× the previous test size (967 KB cached blob
vs 737 KB), Phase 4b stays wall-neutral.  The architectural finding
is decisive: **on synthetic literal-attr IFD workloads, parse+eval
cost ≈ deserialise cost**, so the cache cannot win regardless of
scale.

## Test workload

`/tmp/ifd-huge.nix`:

```nix
let
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> { };
  generated = pkgs.runCommand "ifd-huge-test" {} ''
    mkdir -p $out
    {
      echo 'rec {'
      for i in $(seq 0 9999); do
        echo "  attr$i = { id = $i; label = \"item-$i\"; double = $((i * 2)); triple = $((i * 3)); };"
      done
      echo '  total = 10000;'
      echo '  summary = "10000 entries";'
      echo '}'
    } > $out/result.nix
  '';
  result = import "${generated}/result.nix";
in
{ inherit (result) total summary; sample = result.attr5000; }
```

10000 entries × 4 sub-attrs each = 40 000 leaf values.  Generated
file is ~600 KB of Nix source.

## Measurements (hyperfine n=5)

  | Mode | Mean | σ | Range |
  |------|------|---|-------|
  | OFF  | 879.3 ms | 4.1 ms  | [874.6, 884.8] |
  | WARM | 884.6 ms | 36.3 ms | [859.9, 945.8] |

Speedup: OFF ran 1.01 × faster than WARM.  Within noise (especially
given WARM's σ is ~9× OFF's).

DB size after cold: 15.5 MB total; largest blob 967 KB (the IFD
result), second 737 KB (still cached from prior ifd-large.nix
test in same DB dir).

## Why no wall savings (analysis)

Phase 4b skips the imported file's PARSE + LOWER + COMPILE + RUN on
warm.  But the existing CU disk cache (#770 / #771) already saves
PARSE + LOWER + COMPILE.  So Phase 4b's incremental savings on warm
is just `run()` of the imported CU.

For a literal-attr file like our synthetic, `run()` is essentially:
allocate 1000 outer Bindings entries, 4000 sub-Bindings (4 per attr),
~5000+ Strings (labels, etc.).  **Same work the deserialiser does**:
allocate fresh Bindings, fresh Strings, set context.

Concrete cost breakdown (estimated):
  * `run()` of literal 10K-attr file: ~30-50 ms (10K Bindings allocs)
  * `deserialise` of 967 KB blob: ~30-50 ms (same allocs, plus blob
    parse)

Net: ~0 ms saved.  Cache deserialise adds 30-50 ms wall AND ~700 MB
allocation pressure (the deserialised Bindings tree).

## When would Phase 4b WIN wall?

The condition: **imported expression's eval work >> deserialise cost**.

This happens when:
  1. The imported file computes (not just allocates).  E.g. string
     interpolation, complex attrset construction, derivation
     construction, recursion.
  2. The imported file references derivations that need realisation.
     Each derivation construction is ~ms; 100s of them = significant.
  3. The eval triggers nested IFD probes (haskell.nix's
     callCabalProjectToNix processes thousands of cabal packages,
     each potentially requiring further IFD).

For (3), the cabal2nix output isn't just literal attrs — it includes
generated derivation expressions that the eval must construct.  Each
derivation construction is the ~4-12 ms primop call from #788.  If
the IFD result evaluates 100 derivations, that's 400-1200 ms of work.
Cached, that's all skipped.

**Synthetic test cannot capture this** because literal attrs are
cheaper to eval than derivations to construct.

## Strategic conclusion

Phase 4b is **correct as gated infrastructure**.  Wall economics on
synthetic IFD workloads are flat.  Real-world wall validation
requires a haskell.nix-shape workload with derivation-construction-
heavy IFD results.

This is the FOURTH instance of the same recurring pattern in the
#741 session arc:
  1. Phase 3e ACTIVE: skip libstore-tail → wall-neutral (~50 µs/call too small)
  2. Phase 5 WARM: skip across-process → wall-neutral (~60 µs/lookup amortises)
  3. Phase 4 simple-IFD: skip parse+eval of small attrset → wall-neutral
  4. Phase 4b large-IFD: skip parse+eval of 10K-attr attrset → wall-neutral

Across all four, the cache MACHINERY is correct (validated end-to-end
including byte-identical TW output).  The wall LEVER is bounded by
what's being skipped vs total eval composition.

For #741 to actually move wall:
  * Phase 4 on a workload where derivation-construction IFD dominates
    eval cost.  haskell.nix is the canonical case.
  * OR: a fundamentally different optimization (e.g. faster
    deserialiser via mmap'd cache, content-shared String pool).

## Architecturally complete — sign-off

The #741 IFD content-addressed eval-result cache is **fully landed
as production-grade gated infrastructure**:

  ✓ Round-trip serialiser (Phase 1)
  ✓ Cross-process determinism (Phase 2)
  ✓ In-memory drv-hash + import caches (Phase 3, Phase 4)
  ✓ SQLite cross-process persistence (Phase 5)
  ✓ forceDeep extension for lazy imported values (Phase 4b)
  ✓ Byte-identical TW output across all tested workloads
  ✓ Default-off gates; cost-when-off ≈ 0

Wall validation across measured workloads:
  ✗ hello/gcc/python3/firefox.drvPath: lever too small
  ✗ ifd-simple synthetic: lever too small
  ✗ ifd-large (1K attrs): lever too small
  ✗ ifd-huge (10K attrs): lever too small

Untested (requires substantial setup, out of session scope):
  ? haskell.nix's callCabalProjectToNix on a real cabal project
  ? Determinate / Hercules CI workloads
  ? Nixpkgs CI workloads with IFD derivations

The next investment in #741 should be **either** (a) bringing a
haskell.nix workload to the project, **or** (b) pivoting to a
different lever entirely (Stage 4 v4.4+ strictness, parse-time
optimisations, .name-class workloads from the workload audit).
