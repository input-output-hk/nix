# Phase D (nursery write barriers) — verdict (2026-06-14)

Goal: complete Phase D (the write barriers) to unblock workstream E. **Verdict:
the barriers are NEARLY complete + a strong perf win, but NOT shippable — the
broad `--brute` gate caught one real missed-root class (41 tenured words → one
shared nursery object, on hello), a use-after-free hazard that BLOCKS the
default-on flip. Two things are simultaneously true: (1) once a contention
artifact was removed, the generational nursery is a clear CPU+RSS WIN over the
major-GC default on every deep workload (firefox/HNE/M5), byte-identical +
AUDIT-clean — it achieves E's "cap RSS cheaply" goal via cheap young scavenges
instead of the cache-bound major mark; (2) the BRUTE scanner found a missed root
the narrower gates didn't, so flipping default-on would ship a UAF. Completing
Phase D = fixing that one missed-root class (a targeted GC-scavenger RCA), then
flipping.**

## Found already built
Phase A (Cheney nursery) + Phase C (scavenge) + the Phase D barrier suite are
implemented, gated `NIX_V3_NURSERY=1` (default-off): `barrier.hh` (429 lines);
inter-gen edges → `dirtyContainers` (remembered set); the scavenge walks the
remembered set (gc.cc:1026/1386), not a full O(tenured) walk. Built+gated, not
from scratch. Flipping default-on touches ~5 interacting gates (barriers
barrier.cc:84; allocator+scavenge vm.cc:3233 / nursery.hh:450,459; major-GC
auto-disable alloc.hh:982 — nursery-on ⇒ major mark off = generational).

## Correctness: VALIDATED (barriers complete)
Under `NIX_V3_NURSERY=1` (+ `V3_DBG_NURSERY_AUDIT=1` / `GC_STRESS=1000`):
byte-identical to TW on **hello, git, cargo, rustc, python3.withPackages,
firefox, HNE.hello, M5/cardano-node** (8 workloads incl. the deepest), and **0
BRUTE/AUDIT missed-root signatures** anywhere (AR7 stress harness PASS).

## MEASUREMENT-DISCIPLINE CORRECTION (the "50-150× slow" was an artifact)
A first read had firefox-under-nursery at 146 s / timing out — "50-150×." That
was CPU+memory CONTENTION: five HUNG `repro-a12b-op-call-iter-force.nix` evals
(ELAPSED 2 days, 0 % CPU, ~400 MB Boehm heap each) were paging the host. The
tell: firefox-under-nursery was `146 s real / 4.85 s user`. After `pkill`-ing
them, all numbers below are clean (user-CPU is contention-robust regardless).
The v3-vs-tw gate's "noisy host" warning, in the flesh — check for stray procs
before trusting wall.

## Performance (CLEAN, user-CPU + v3_arena; nursery vs the current major-GC default)
| workload | major-GC (default) | nursery | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| firefox | 5.24 s / arena 503 MB / RSS 622 MB | 4.26 s / **470 MB** / 455-631 | **−19 % CPU, −33 MB arena** |
| HNE.hello | 13.60 s / 788 MB / RSS 2105 MB | **6.37 s** / 755 MB / **1382 MB** | **−53 % CPU, −33 MB arena, −723 MB maxRSS** |
| M5/cardano | 34.78 s / 2147 MB / RSS 1894 MB | **20.14 s** / 2131 MB / 1771 MB | **−42 % CPU, −16 MB arena, −123 MB maxRSS** |

The nursery is CHEAPER and comparable-or-lower RSS on all three — because its
cheap young scavenges keep the arena bounded WITHOUT paying the cache-bound
major mark (firefox major mark ~1.3 s; HNE/M5 much more). The large maxRSS wins
(HNE −723 MB) are partly the avoided mark working-set spike; the arena (the true
heap) is comparable-to-slightly-better.

## Why this UNBLOCKS E (and corrects the E verdict's framing)
E wanted to cap firefox's scattered dead by firing GC mid-eval; it failed
because the major mark is cache-bound (+38.8 % per fire). **The nursery solves
the same problem differently**: instead of an expensive whole-live-set major
mark, it does cheap young scavenges (copy survivors, drop young dead) that keep
the arena bounded continuously. So the generational collector IS the cheap
RSS-bounding GC E needed — and it's a net CPU WIN, not a +15 % cost. The
"tenured-dead needs the major mark" framing in an earlier draft was wrong: the
data shows the nursery keeps the arena comparable to the major GC (HNE 755 vs
788, M5 2131 vs 2147) while avoiding the mark.

## `--brute` FOUND A MISSED ROOT → flip BLOCKED (the discipline paid off)
The broad gate `all-v3-tests --brute` (core suite under a 1 MB nursery +
aggressive scavenge + `V3_DBG_NURSERY_BRUTE`/`_AUDIT`) = **21/22; the
`brute-audit` suite FAILED**:

```
v3 SCAVENGE BRUTE: 41 tenured words point into nursery   (hello-name/-drvPath/-outPath, gcc-name)
```

A BRUTE hit = a tenured arena word holds a nursery pointer the scavenge did NOT
forward — a **missed root = use-after-free hazard**. The dump is precise: all 41
holders point to the SAME nursery object (`0xb364aac80`) — ONE widely-shared
nursery object, referenced 41× from scattered tenured cells, not forwarded. So
it is a single missed-root class: either 41 writes that bypassed the barrier
helpers, or that object's type isn't walked by a per-type scavenger walker.

This did NOT surface as a divergence on the 8 byte-identity workloads or the AR7
stress (those objects weren't reclaimed-then-read on those paths) — but the
dedicated whole-tenured-heap BRUTE scanner caught it. **This is exactly the
latent UAF a default-on flip would expose on some untested package.**

## Disposition
- **Phase D barriers: NEARLY complete, but NOT complete** — one precisely
  characterized missed-root class remains (1 shared nursery object × 41 tenured
  holders, reproducible on hello.drvPath under the brute config).
- **Nursery: a validated PERF win** (−19/−53/−42 % CPU + comparable/better RSS;
  byte-identical + AUDIT-clean on 8 workloads + GC_STRESS=1000) — so fixing the
  missed root is high-value (it unblocks a cheaper, RSS-capping default GC = E).
- **Default-on flip: BLOCKED** on the missed root. Flipping now would ship a
  use-after-free. NOT flipped.
- **The remaining work (the genuine "Phase D unresolved" core):** RCA the missed
  root — identify the holder cell class + the shared object's type, find the
  unbarriered write site (a raw `*cell = …` / `entries[i].value = …` bypassing
  the `barrier.hh` helpers) or the missing per-type scavenger walk in `gc.cc`,
  add it, and re-run the brute scanner to confirm 0 hits. A targeted, careful
  GC-scavenger debugging task (a wrong walker fix is another UAF) — for a fresh
  session, not the tail of this one. NB: under the nursery the major-GC is off
  (M-3), so the cell-start bitmap (which `findContainingCellStart`/`cellTypeAt`
  use to type the holder) is not maintained — the RCA needs the brute scanner
  taught to type holders without it (e.g. keep cell-start bookkeeping on under
  `V3_DBG_NURSERY_BRUTE`).

The measure-twice value: validation (a) confirmed the barriers are *mostly*
correct, (b) caught + corrected a contention artifact (the "50-150× slow"),
(c) showed the nursery is a strong perf win that achieves E's goal, and (d) — via
the broad BRUTE gate — caught a real missed root that the narrower gates missed,
correctly blocking a UAF-shipping default-on flip. No flip, no rushed GC change.

## PhD-6 RCA UPDATE (2026-06-14, post-FP-2): the missed root SPLIT INTO TWO

Built a **typed BRUTE scanner** (4b8cf66cc) — `postScavengeBruteScan` now reports
each live missed-root word's HOLDER CellType + field offset (`[holder=Bindings
@+48]`) via a typed `ScavLiveRange` carrying the type each `walk*` already knows.
A same-host-bisect (FP-2a/eca683aa1 vs HEAD) on hello.drvPath under the aggressive
brute config (1 MB nursery, constant scavenge) then split the "41-words" blocker
into **two independent phenomena**:

1. **The 43-words `capturedWiths` missed root — FIXED by FP-2b (incidentally).**
   Pre-FP-2b: BRUTE = **43 tenured words → 1 shared nursery obj** (`0xb0c0a3820`).
   Post-FP-2b: BRUTE = **0 live**.  FP-2b's corrected withs-slot evac-forward
   (`thunkSetCapturedWiths(fwdList(w))` + `thunkScanSize` incl. the slot) forwards
   those references correctly.  So the header-`capturedWiths` field was the
   41/43-words holder class, and relocating+forwarding it via the FAM tail closed
   that missed-root class.  (This is *why* FP-2b's `--brute` count was "unchanged
   at 21/22" — the BRUTE-hit sub-cases flipped to 0-live, but the case still fails
   on phenomenon #2 below, which short-circuits on `rc!=0` before the BRUTE check.)

2. **`error: undefined variable 'gnuabi64'` — the REAL remaining blocker, distinct
   and PRE-EXISTING (NOT FP-2b).**  Reproduces at BOTH pre- and post-FP-2b under
   aggressive scavenge, with **AUDIT clean + BRUTE 0-live (post-FP-2b)**.  It is a
   *wrong evaluation* (a lost `with`-binding — `gnuabi64` is a free var resolved
   through a `with abis;`-style scope), NOT a dangling nursery pointer — so BOTH
   the arena BRUTE scan and the deep-walk AUDIT miss it.  Only under the aggressive
   1 MB nursery (many scavenges); the DEFAULT-size nursery evaluates hello.drvPath
   byte-identically.  Scavenge-frequency-dependent = classic missed-root, but of a
   class the current scanners don't cover.

**Next concrete RCA step for gnuabi64 (first hypothesis already REFUTED):** the
obvious guess — `vm.withStack`/`vm.valueStack` not forwarded — is WRONG: the
scavenger DOES forward both (gc.cc:805-806 `visitValue`) and the AUDIT walks both
(gc.cc:1311-1314), all clean.  So the with-attrset Value on the stack is forwarded
correctly.  The bug is therefore deeper — candidates, in rough priority:
  1. **Truncated/stale with-attrset Bindings copy** — the abis Bindings is
     forwarded but the gnuabi64 ENTRY isn't copied (a `walkBindings`/`fwdBindings`
     size or entry-loop bug under back-to-back scavenges), so `OP_WITH_LOOKUP`
     finds the attrset but not the name → "undefined variable."
  2. **Stale cached lookup after a move** — an inline cache / `attrSelectCache` /
     memoised with-lookup slot pointing at the pre-move location (the IC walk at
     gc.cc:679/705 forwards IC'd Bindings, but a with-lookup-specific cache may be
     uncovered).
  3. **A with-attrset built in the nursery and forwarded mid-construction** (pushed
     onto withStack before all entries were written).
Instrument `OP_WITH_LOOKUP` to dump, on the failing gnuabi64 lookup, the
with-stack attrsets it searched (count + sizes + whether any was recently
forwarded), and/or add a post-scavenge check that every withStack attrset's entry
count is preserved across the copy.  Aggressive-1MB-nursery + hello.drvPath is the
deterministic repro.  NOTE: FP-2b already closed the capturedWiths missed-root
class, so gnuabi64 is the SOLE remaining nursery-flip blocker.

## PhD-6 RESOLVED — all 3 classes FIXED; flip unblocked but RSS payoff reframed (2026-06-14)

**Correctness (the campaign-long blocker): RESOLVED.** All three missed-root
classes are fixed (be3b9bae9 capturedWiths cache / gnuabi64; ebba1a684 materialize
memo; d361886a7 raw forced-result writebacks).  The nursery is now **`--brute`
CLEAN**: full `all-v3-tests --brute` = 21/22, the sole failure being `brute-audit`
whose only failing sub-case is a STALE TEST GOLDEN (firefox-name want=150.0.3 vs
nixpkgs's current 151.0.4 — a version-drift to refresh, NOT a missed root).
hello.drvPath under the aggressive 1 MB nursery: 0 AUDIT hits (was 3), 0 BRUTE
live, gnuabi64-free, drvPath byte-identical.  Byte-identical under the major-GC
default everywhere (06-07 canary 5/5, core 21/21).

**BUT the flip's RSS payoff is REFRAMED (honest correction to this doc's earlier
"caps RSS cheaply" framing).** Quick check, firefox.drvPath, now-correct:
major-GC default peak_rss **618 MB** vs nursery **820 MB (+202 MB WORSE)**; arena
identical (453), drvPath byte-identical.  Mechanism: the nursery scavenges only
YOUNG churn; under it the major GC is OFF (M-3), so the **224 MB *tenured*
stranded dead is NOT reclaimed**, and the Cheney semispace adds overhead.  On a
single-pass drvPath eval (where major-GC fires once near the end and reclaims),
the nursery LOSES that reclaim → higher peak.  So: **the nursery is a CPU lever
(avoid the cache-bound major mark on mark-heavy repeated workloads — the Phase D
−19/−53/−42 % numbers), NOT a peak-RSS lever; the Layer-C 224 MB tenured-dead
reclaim needs a GENERATIONAL MAJOR collection (mark the tenured set) ON TOP of the
nursery — the nursery alone is necessary infra but not sufficient for that win.**
Flipping default-on is therefore a workload-dependent cost/benefit decision (now
that it's SAFE), needing: re-measured HNE/M5 CPU wins + nursery-size tuning +
the firefox RSS regression understood/accepted or a generational major pass added.
NOT auto-flipped.

**UPDATE (2026-06-14): the generational major pass is now IMPLEMENTED + measured
(Shape A, `GENERATIONAL_MAJOR_DESIGN_2026-06-14.md §RESULT`, commit 77dc0299c).**
Opt-in `NIX_V3_GEN_MAJOR=1`: scavenge-then-major at the safepoint (M-3-safe, the
nursery is empty when the major runs).  Correct (hello byte-identical + AUDIT 0 +
canary 5/5 + core 21/21).  Measured: it reclaims the tenured stranded dead on M5
(**−624 MB vs major-default, 2492→1868, at +3 % CPU**) — firefox only matches the
one major-GC (589≈580), since firefox's dead is already major-reclaimed (the
firefox-centric falsifier premise was mis-targeted; the dead lives on M5).  **Net
vs the production major-GC default, gen-major wins on BOTH headline workloads**
(M5 −624 MB RSS @ +3 % CPU; firefox −13 % CPU @ neutral RSS).  Ships as the opt-in
lever; the nursery's own RSS effect is workload-dependent (firefox +59 MB /
M5 −241 MB) so it's a CPU lever, gen-major adds the RSS reclaim.  Default-flip
remains the user's cost/benefit call; Shape B (Immix tenured) is a future
contingency only if a workload needs more than Shape A delivers.

## PhD-6 RCA RESOLVED to 3 missed-root CLASSES (2026-06-14, continued)

The nursery's missed roots are THREE distinct classes — two now FIXED, one
characterized.  The unifying theme: **scavenge-unaware state that the BRUTE
(arena scan) + AUDIT (root deep-walk) gates don't cover** (C++-side caches), plus
a generational barrier-coverage gap.

1. **capturedWiths intern cache (`gnuabi64`) — FIXED (be3b9bae9).**  A 4096-bucket
   C++ static (`s_capWithsCache`) of singleton with-list `ListVec*`, not a
   scavenge root → stale after the nursery forwards a cached list → a hit returns
   a size-0/reused slot → empty `with`-scope → `undefined variable`.  Found via
   the V3_DBG_WITH dump (firing thunk: nWith=1, capW non-null, but withBase==top).
   Proven via `NIX_V3_NO_CAPWITHS_INTERN=1` A/B.  Fix: bypass the cache when
   `phaseDActive()` (nursery allocs are cheap; cache stays for the non-moving
   major-GC default).  Result: `gcc-name` passes, gnuabi64 gone, byte-identical.

2. **materialize memo (`s_matMemo`) — FIXED (preventive, nursery-safety) (this
   session).**  chain→materialised-Bindings cache, cleared only at the major-GC
   safepoint (vm.cc:3506); under the nursery (major-GC off) it's never cleared,
   yet every scavenge moves its raw pointers → stale/aliased per the M-1 reasoning.
   Fix: extend the clear to the scavenge path (after `sc.run()`).  Required
   nursery-safety; not the current AUDIT-hit cause.

3. **A tenured-Bindings→nursery missed root — OPEN, and NOT what I first
   guessed.**  AUDIT signature: tenured `Bindings.entries[N].value -> nursery`
   (hello-drvPath/outPath, entries[16/38/49]), reachable from roots, that the
   scavenger (young + dirty-list, not all reachable tenured) didn't forward.

   **FALSIFIED first hypothesis ("~30 unbarriered construction sites"):** an audit
   of the actual code shows construction IS barriered everywhere —
   `OP_ATTRS_INIT` uses `bindingsSetValue` (vm.cc:8455), essentially all ~30
   primops.cc `allocBindings`+fill sites use `bindingsSetValue`/`bindingsSetEntry`
   ("// Phase D"), `materialize` uses `bindingsPostConstructBarrier(out)`, the
   OP_RETURN cell-writeback uses `cellWrite`→`standaloneCellRoots` (barrier.hh:423)
   which the scavenge walks (gc.cc:1071/1398), and there are no raw `*cell=`/
   `*slot=` writebacks bypassing it.  So the construction-gap theory is WRONG; do
   NOT add blanket barriers (they're already there).

   **CORRECTION (Rule 0, 2026-06-14): the "promotion staleness" story below was
   OVER-CLAIMED as confirmed — it has a hole.**  A Cheney promotion COPIES AND
   SCANS the Bindings, forwarding its entries, so a *promoted* `B'` ends up
   correct.  That means promotion-staleness does NOT explain a *tenured* B holding
   an un-forwarded nursery entry (the actual AUDIT signature).  The raw-interior-
   pointer registry IS move-unsafe in general (the mechanism below is real), but
   it is NOT established as the cause of THIS hit.  Two reasoned hypotheses have
   now both been holed (construction-gap, promotion-staleness) → STOP reasoning;
   the cause requires the last-writer instrument (see "REAL next step" at the end).

   **(retained as a real move-unsafety, not the proven cause): the OP_RETURN
   cell-writeback registers a raw interior cell pointer.**  All three `cellWrite`
   calls (vm.cc:2814/2834/7411)
   pass `cellContainer = nullptr`, so for a forced-thunk result the barrier takes
   the standalone branch — `standaloneCellRoots().push_back(cell)` where `cell =
   &B.entries[N].value` (barrier.hh:422-423).  Under the MOVING nursery, when B is
   promoted nursery→tenured, that raw interior pointer is NOT updated (the registry
   has no back-link to B), so it dangles at B's old (from-space) address; the
   scavenge walks the stale cell, while the real promoted `B'.entries[N].value`
   still holds the un-forwarded nursery Closure/ListVec → the AUDIT hit.  Evidence:
   (1) all construction is barriered via the move-safe DirtyKind::Bindings path, so
   only the writeback path is exposed; (2) the AUDIT values are Closure/ListVec =
   forced results written by OP_RETURN, not thunks from construction; (3) it only
   bites under a moving collector (raw cells are stable under the non-moving
   major-GC default, where this code is correct).  This is a moving-GC consequence
   of **M-8** (CODEBASE_REVIEW_2026-06-11), which dropped `Thunk::cellContainer`
   (barrier.hh:14 — "so OP_RETURN's cell-write can find its containing Bindings")
   to shrink the thunk header, replacing the move-safe container-dirty-list with
   the move-unsafe raw-cell registry.  Same family as fixes #1/#2: scavenge-unaware
   raw pointers under a moving collector.

   **REAL next step — INSTRUMENT, don't reason (two hypotheses now holed):** add a
   gated last-writer tag.  A thread_local `map<const Value* cell, {site, was-
   nursery-at-write, registered?}>` populated at `cellWrite` / `bindingsSetValue` /
   `bindingsSetEntry` / the materialize bulk-copy; at the AUDIT, look up the
   offending `&B.entries[N].value` (stable — B is tenured) and print HOW/where it
   was last written and whether the barrier should have caught it.  That
   distinguishes: (i) a write that bypassed all setters (→ find the raw path);
   (ii) a write where `isNurseryPayload(v)` was false at write-time but v later
   resolved to nursery (→ a Slot/late-resolution gap); (iii) a re-write after the
   cell was registered+dropped in an earlier scavenge.  Only after the data names
   the path do the fix options (move-safe registry: bitmap-derived container
   dirty-list / `(Bindings*,idx)` registration / scavenger interior-pointer fixup)
   become a targeted choice.  This is the FINAL PhD-6 layer before the
   nursery-flip 5-gate.

## RESOLUTION (2026-06-15) — the flip blocker was a NEW class, now fixed

The full-gate default-on flip was attempted: byte-correct on hello + firefox,
but `git.drvPath` raised **7 SCAVENGE AUDIT missed roots** (`nursery Thunk
reachable via ListVec.elems[]`). The flip was reverted (latent UAF). RCA +
fix in `CODEBASE_REVIEW_2026-06-15.md`; summary:

- **NOT the Bindings writebacks, NOT the deep-force writebacks.** The AUDIT
  reported nursery *Thunks* — lazy elements, not forced WHNF — so the culprit
  was **lazy list CONSTRUCTION** storing nursery thunks into a *tenured* list
  (a list is tenured when the nursery was full at `allocList`/`nurseryOrArena`
  time). A new instrument (gc.cc `visitList` + `listOriginTable` alloc-site)
  named it: **`primZipAttrsWith`** built a value-list of lazy thunks and skipped
  `listPostConstructBarrier` — unlike siblings primMap/primTail/primAttrNames.

- **Fix = class-3 completion (list side):** add `listPostConstructBarrier` at
  every nursery-capable list-construction primop (zipAttrsWith, attrValues,
  concatLists, filter, concatMap, partition, catAttrs, genericClosure, split,
  groupBy, fromTOML, fromJSON) + the `forceDeepRec` writeback (NOT root-covered,
  unlike print.cc `forceDeep` whose `tlDeepForceRoots` IS scavenge-walked).
  Verified-safe sites (string/null-only, tenured-attrset, genList tenured-pairs,
  empty) skipped with documentation. Commits `6643ef8a4` + `67856e930`.

- **Validated:** git AUDIT 7→0 byte-identical; hello/git/firefox 0 hits
  byte-identical (flip-equiv `NIX_V3_NURSERY=1 NIX_V3_NURSERY_SCAVENGE=1
  NIX_V3_GEN_MAJOR=1 NIX_V3_NO_MAJOR_GC=1`); brute battery 15/15; `--core` lang
  21/21; new regression `test/repro-phd6-list-primop-barriers.nix` clean.

- **vm.cc:11459 `deepForceList` `forceWriteTarget`** (the older "Round 1 #6"
  latent): re-audited — empirically clean (fold-genlist-100k brute stress, no
  hit/crash; value-stack-root recovery + re-derivation = memoization-loss-only).

**Net: the correctness blocker is resolved; the default-on flip is unblocked.**
Remaining flip steps are mechanical (re-apply gates, rebuild ALL binaries,
broader nixpkgs byte-equality sweep) + the cost/benefit default decision
(nursery = CPU lever, RSS workload-dependent; gen-major Shape A = the RSS lever).
