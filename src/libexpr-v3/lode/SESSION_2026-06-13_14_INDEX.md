# Session index — BEAT_TW_V2 execution (2026-06-13 → 06-14)

Canonical entry point for the work implementing `PLAN_BEAT_TW_V2_2026-06-13.md`.
Branch `angerman/2.35-eval-profiling-v2`, from `c2a8f0bee`. Every row links to its
commit (the primary record, with A/B data + the hypothesis it kills — Rule 0).
Deeper write-ups: `PLAN_BEAT_TW_V2_EXECUTION_2026-06-13.md` (Wave-1 + WS-A table),
`BROADER_A_SCOPING_2026-06-14.md`. Cross-session memory:
`gc_trigger_tuning_falsified_2026-06-13`, `beat_tw_v2_wave1_results_2026-06-13`,
`broader_a_scoping_2026-06-14`.

## Headline
The "cheap wins" wave is tapped out: the §0.2 micro-shares don't reproduce as
wall wins (hello.drvPath is import/disk_cache-dominated), and the firefox-GC cost
is structurally hard (BOTH levers falsified). Confirmed wins come from the two
levers that survived measurement (§1.2 + §1.1b). The firefox RSS lever is NOT
materialize-removal (total materialize = 72MB) — it's the eval heap (→ workstream H).

## Ledger (item → verdict → commit → evidence)

| §1.1b adaptive GC backoff (heap×8 on freed<5%) | **SHIPPED** | `0ddc9ad6a` | M5 CPU 26.4→**19.5s (−26%)**, arena-identical, HNE-safe |
| §1.7 OP_APPLY_OVERRIDES chain guard | **SHIPPED** | `40a64c2dd` | latent C-1-class correctness fix; run-1.7 8/8 |
| §1.3 materialize k-way merge | **FALSIFIED/reverted** | (exec-log) | noise: introsort ≈1% not the projected 9% |
| §1.4 has-context presence filter | **FALSIFIED/reverted** | (exec-log) | +10.5% SLOWER (find already cheap on tiny tables) |
| §1.5 cross-Force deferral / §1.6 OP_RETURN diet | **DEFERRED** | (exec-log) | sub-bar by analysis (~0.3% fib) |
| §1.8 mark speedup (block-aligned mmap) | **FALSIFIED** | `916ab91ea` | mark is **cache-bound** (225ns/cell, regionOf <10%) → can't hit −60% |
| E-stage-0 (mid-eval live trace) | **VIABLE** | (exec-log) | firefox L_resident 0.44 < 0.80, dead-lines 42.7% |
| DP-1 7-row re-pin + QG-4 ratchet | **SHIPPED** | `812912ed4` | `seven-rows.tsv` + `make ratchet-check`; attrNames **0.46×** (v3 wins), fib 1.37×, foldl 3.16×, hello 1.28×, git 1.54×, firefox 2.38×, M5 2.31× |
| WS-A.1 tests-first (06-07 canary) | **SHIPPED** | `a01bdd024` | git/cargo/rustc/cargo-auditable.cargoDeps/python3.withPackages byte-identical 5/5 |
| suite registration (§1.7 + canary) | **SHIPPED** | `f9ce54fb7` | core 21/21 |
| WS-A.2 shared-parent-writeback counter | **SHIPPED + FINDING** | `d6a3265eb` | writebacks PERVASIVE + **BENIGN** (firefox 18, byte-identical) = correct-WHNF memo like TW; "shared-parent write = C-1" is FALSE |
| WS-A.3 chain-SELECT **L1 + provenance assert** | **SHIPPED (gated)** | `e890e3502` | `NIX_V3_CHAIN_LOOKUP_SELECT`; 06-07 5/5, lang 143, core 21/21 gate-on, **provenance 0 violations** (C-1 refuted), aggressive-GC clean |
| L1 darwin-4 formal RSS bar (QG-2) | **MEASURED → gated** | `136b35883` | firefox −33.6MB arena / −29MB maxRSS, byte-identical, CPU-neutral — **below −40MB revert floor** → not default-on |
| **FP-0** re-shape the RSS bar (per-lever → cumulative) | **DONE** | (FP commit) | −80MB single-lever floor RETIRED (tax is distributed → levers are 15-40MB by construction); `baselines/cumulative-rss-ledger.tsv` banks wins, `seven-rows.tsv` stays the regression guard |
| **FP-1** un-gate L1 default-on | **SHIPPED** | (FP commit) | flipped `NIX_V3_CHAIN_LOOKUP_SELECT` default-ON (opt-out =0); laptop firefox arena **503.3→469.8 (−33.5MB)**, =0 reproduces 503.3 exactly; re-confirmed 06-07 5/5 + core 21/21 + lang 143 byte-identical at the new default |
| broader lookup-without-materialize | **SCOPED → RETIRED** | `878d6a190` | total materialize 72MB firefox / 40MB hello < 80MB bar → unreachable; **pivot to eval heap** |
| workstream H sizing (upvalue-dup probe) | **SIZED → small** | `f9dd326b5` | firefox 30MB upvalue-tail / **12MB recoverable**; thunk tax is the 40B HEADER (75MB ff), not upvalues → H NOT the firefox lever. M5 unsizable under probe. |
| workstream E (depth>0 GC + span reuse) | **FALSIFIED @ stage-1 CPU bar** | (E_DEPTH0_VERDICT doc) | one firefox full-mark GC = **+38.8%** (3.38→4.69s) ≫ +15% bar, from ONE fire; mark cache-bound (§1.8) + non-generational. Gated on generational marking (nursery/Phase D, multi-week). Cheap-projection kill, no depth>0 impl. |
| Phase D (nursery write barriers) | **barriers ~done + WIN, but flip BLOCKED** | (PHASE_D_VERDICT doc) | nursery is a big win (firefox/HNE/M5 −19/−53/−42% CPU, byte-identical, achieves E's RSS-cap cheaply) BUT `--brute` caught a real missed root (41 tenured words → 1 shared nursery obj on hello) = UAF → NOT flipped. Artifact corrected ("50-150× slow" = 5 hung repro-a12b zombies). Fix = PhD-6 GC RCA (fresh session). |

## Gated artifacts left in place (reproduce any number / guard regressions)
- Regression canaries: `test/run-chain-select-0607-failure-set.sh`, `test/run-1.7-apply-overrides-tests.sh` (in core suite)
- QG-4 ratchet: `bench/pin-seven-rows.sh`, `bench/ratchet-check.sh`, `bench/baselines/seven-rows.tsv`
- Measurement gates (default-off): `V3_DBG_SHARED_WB` (provenance + shared-WB counter), `V3_DBG_MAT_SITES` (per-caller materialize attribution), the `markMs`/`mark-split` stats, `NIX_V3_CHAIN_LOOKUP_SELECT` (L1)

## Open / next direction
**No cheap firefox RSS lever remains** — both candidates measured small: broader-A
≤72MB (mostly a cap trade), workstream H ≤30MB (the thunk tax is the 40B-per-thunk
HEADER, ~75MB firefox / ~680MB M5, which capture-sharing can't touch). The firefox
RSS is the live eval heap: the **224MB scattered dead** plus the 40B/thunk header.
But every in-reach RSS lever is now measured-and-blocked: broader-A ≤72MB (cap
trade), H ≤30MB (header-dominated), and **workstream E is falsified at its stage-1
CPU bar** (one firefox full-mark GC = +38.8% ≫ +15%; the cache-bound
non-generational mark can't fire mid-eval within budget). The most promising remaining
firefox lever is now concrete and de-risked: **the generational nursery (Phase D)
is a validated −19/−53/−42% CPU win that caps RSS cheaply** (achieving E's goal),
blocked only on **one characterized missed root** (PhD-6: 41 tenured words → 1
shared nursery obj on hello — a targeted GC-scavenger RCA, NOT shipped because it
is a UAF). Fix that one root → flip the nursery default-on → completes Phase D +
E in one stroke. Secondary: **CPU work (workstream C — dispatch)**. A thunk-header shrink is a smaller representation
follow-up. M5/cardano H sizing needs a sampling-probe variant. **L1 is now default-on**
(FP-1, −33.5MB firefox banked; the recalibrated cumulative bar is FP-0). The
integrated forward plan is `lode/MEMORY_FORWARD_PLAN_2026-06-14.md` (FP-0..FP-4:
bar-reshape → L1 → thunk-header 40→24B → pair tax → generational nursery). Gated
tools left in place: `V3_DBG_MAT_SITES`, `V3_DBG_UPVAL_DUP`, `V3_DBG_SHARED_WB`,
`NIX_V3_CHAIN_LOOKUP_SELECT=0` (now the L1 opt-out / falsifier handle).
