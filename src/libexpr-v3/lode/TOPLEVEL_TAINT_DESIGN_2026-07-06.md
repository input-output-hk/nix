# A1 precise-taint design decision — empirical-corpus wins (2026-07-06)

Design fan-out (3 opus agents) for the top-level cross-process cache's insert-gate
soundness mechanism, reconciled adversarially. Grounded at HEAD de6ceb4d5.

## The problem
The top-level result cache (run.cc:1799/1822 key, 1867 insert-gate) memoizes the
whole-eval WHNF result cross-process. Today's taint is a CONSERVATIVE GLOBAL bool
`g_topLevelTaint` (primops.cc:6799-6802) bumped at exactly TWO sites — getEnv
(1855) + currentTime (3919). It OVER-REJECTS: nixpkgs calls currentTime in
result-irrelevant branches, so hello/firefox.drvPath are tainted=1 and NEVER
cache despite being deterministic (v1 shadow: mismatch==0). Goal: cache iff the
impurity does NOT reach the serialized result.

## Two approaches evaluated
### (i) Taint-bit-on-Value (precise data-flow) — REJECTED
- NO free bit in the 8B NaN-boxed Value (fully spoken for; pointers use all 48
  payload bits, floats are raw doubles) → taint must live on stable GC CELLS
  (Thunk flag bit THUNK_TAINTED=1<<3 is free; but containers need a side-set with
  GC-evac relocation = the missed-root/UAF class).
- **FATAL: pure data-flow taint is UNSOUND** — it misses CONTROL-FLOW laundering
  (`if getEnv "X" == "root" then "a" else "b"` — the condition is impure, the
  result differs across env, but neither branch value is individually tainted).
  Closing it needs IMPLICIT-FLOW taint (taint any branch whose condition is
  tainted), which OVER-taints: for nixpkgs (currentTime in conditions
  pervasively) it would RE-INTRODUCE the over-rejection we're fixing. So the
  "precise" approach, made sound, is no more precise than today's global bool.
- Cost: ~3-4 weeks; PRIMOP_IMPURE flag exists (primop.hh:373) but set on ZERO
  primops → from-scratch audit of all 131 primops; hot-path shadow-stack is a
  Rule-0 perf-regression risk; GC-relocation of container taint is a UAF risk.

### (ii) Empirical-corpus (policy P) — CHOSEN
- Does NOT analyze flows; MEASURES whether the result is byte-stable under
  PERTURBATION of the impurity sources (getEnv → sentinels, currentTime →
  advanced clock via a test hook). A result byte-identical across the perturbed
  runs is genuinely pure w.r.t. those axes → cache it. This SIDESTEPS the
  control-flow problem entirely (it observes the result varying, not the flow).
- Runtime policy P (replaces the run.cc:1867 gate): untainted → insert; TAINTED
  → re-run once in-process under a perturbed impurity env, insert ONLY if the
  serialized result is byte-identical. Reuses the existing shadow machinery
  (topLevelCacheShadow, byte-compare, TopLevelCacheStats).
- Coverage: **~95-100%** of the .drvPath/.name/.outPath corpus (nixpkgs recipes
  are pure; currentTime is in result-irrelevant branches) vs **~0%** for taint-bit.
- Soundness: default P ON only under `--pure-eval` (impurity surface is
  store-content-addressed-bounded ≈ EXACTLY nix's own flake eval-cache trust
  contract); opt-in under `--impure`. Residual risk = impurity axes neither
  tainted nor perturbed → mitigated to an ENUMERABLE obligation (taint/perturb
  every impure primop) rather than taint-bit's UNBOUNDED per-Value obligation.
- Effort: ~5-7 days, front-loaded on the perturbation harness so coverage% is
  known before policy P is built.

## Decision & rationale
**Empirical-corpus (policy P), default-on under `--pure-eval`.** It is cheaper
(~1/4 the effort), gets ~95-100% coverage the taint-bit forfeits, and is MORE
sound on the control-flow case (by measurement, not by an over-tainting flow
analysis). The taint-bit is DEFERRED as an unattractive "provable" path whose
sound form regresses to over-rejection.

## PREREQUISITE (both approaches need it — build FIRST): taint all impure primops
Confirmed by BOTH design agents: taint today covers only getEnv+currentTime.
readFile/readDir/pathExists/readFileType/hashFile/fetchTree/fetchGit/
fetchTarball/getFlake/storePath/getContext/exec + IFD-derived reads do NOT bump
taint — a silent-wrong-result hole for ANY caching policy (an un-tainted
impurity reaching the result is served stale cross-process). Extend
topLevelTaintBump to the full impure-primop set (+ tryEval body taint + the
existing ifdProbeWithCtx discriminator for IFD). This is the SOUND-DIRECTION
first step (makes the cache MORE conservative → strictly safe; policy P then
recovers the tainted-but-stable coverage). +/-/R: + a pure result still caches;
- readFile/readDir/pathExists/fetch reaching the result → tainted, not cached +
cross-version not-stale; R failing-first TL cases. Bump the cache-policy version
(run.cc:1833 v2→v3) so older-binary entries never collide.

## ADVERSARIAL REVIEW VERDICT (2026-07-06) — policy-P re-run REJECTED; reroute to bitmask + manifest
The pre-build soundness review found the in-process re-run design (as written)
**serves a wrong drvPath**, and rejected it:
- **FATAL: single-bit taint.** `g_topLevelTaint` is ONE bool — it cannot tell
  WHICH impurity fired. Policy P perturbs only getEnv+currentTime; a readFile-
  derived result is tainted, the re-run reads the SAME (unperturbable) file →
  byte-identical → INSERTS → file changes → stale wrong result. Silent whole-eval
  miscompile.
- **Re-run is risky even fixed**: re-entrancy (depth guard), 2× cost on the
  tainted path, lowering-nondeterminism polluting the compare, taint-reset
  (run.cc:328) clobbering the base-run taint before capture, FFI leaves reading
  ambient state below the primop boundary, and 2-point clock-stability is not a
  purity proof.
- `--pure-eval`-default is sound ONLY WITH the axis-bitmask reject-set (pureEval
  does NOT block readFile of a mutable non-store path → still reachable → must be
  reject-set, not re-run).

**RECONCILED A1 PLAN (post-review) — strictly sound, no in-process re-run:**
1. **Axis bitmask (MUST-FIX #1, blocking):** convert `g_topLevelTaint` bool →
   `uint32_t` per-axis mask (TAINT_GETENV / TAINT_CURRENTTIME / TAINT_READFILE /
   TAINT_FETCH / TAINT_STORE / …); the 12 bump sites set their specific bit.
   Foundational for ANY precise policy. Over-approximation preserved (strictly
   safe). +/-/R: the existing TL2-TL5 still pass (they assert not-stale, which
   the reject-set upholds).
2. **Reject-set insert gate:** insert iff taint mask has NO bit outside
   `PERTURBABLE_MASK = {getEnv, currentTime}`; i.e. untainted OR only clock/env-
   tainted-AND-manifest-validated. Any readFile/readDir/pathExists/fetch/store/
   getFlake taint → hard REJECT (never insert). This alone is strictly sound
   (Alt-2 baseline) and can ship immediately (≈ today's coverage, but now
   PRECISE about which taint is recoverable).
3. **Offline manifest (Alt-1) to recover the clock-stable win:** the perturbation
   harness (bench/toplevel-cache-coverage.sh, already built + measured 98%) runs
   OFFLINE over the ≥50-pkg corpus and emits a signed manifest of clock-stable
   source-hashes. Production inserts a CLOCK-ONLY-tainted result iff its
   source-hash ∈ manifest; manifest-hash goes into the cache key; re-validate on
   nixpkgs bumps. This recovers the 98% corpus win with NO in-process re-run
   (= nix's flake-eval-cache trust model). SHIP gate (hello/firefox.drvPath +
   M5.name cross-process byte-id) achievable via manifest membership.
4. Policy-version bump v3-toplevel-v3 → -v4 on ship; ≥3 adversarial perturbation
   points offline; FFI-leaf ambient-read audit (writeDerivation embeds no
   timestamp — store paths are hash-based, confirm).
**DROP: the in-process re-run** (unsound as written, risky even fixed). The
manifest recovers the same win soundly.

## Build order for A1
1. [prereq] taint-all-impure-primops + version bump + tests + brute + commit.
2. perturbation harness (6-run: identical×2, getEnv-perturbed×2, currentTime-
   perturbed×2 via NIX_V3_FAKE_CURRENTTIME hook) + a >=50-pkg corpus manifest.
3. measure coverage% on the corpus (the SHIP go/no-go).
4. policy P (two-tier insert gate) + --pure-eval default + tests + brute.
5. darwin-4 GATE: cross-process byte-id HITs on hello/firefox.drvPath + M5.name,
   shadow mismatch==0 over the corpus, T_hit/T_eval<=0.20 → SHIP; else DEFER.

## VETTED IMPLEMENTATION SPEC (2026-07-06, opus adversarial soundness pass)
Grounded at HEAD (taint = per-axis mask primops.cc:6814; key `v3-toplevel-v3`
run.cc:1837; gate = reject-all-tainted run.cc:1871). The DECISIVE soundness
resolution + the buildable spec (a wrong top-level cache = SILENT WHOLE-EVAL
MISCOMPILE, so this was reviewed before any gate edit):

**Q1 getEnv (the hole found pre-build): RESOLVED.** Under `--pure-eval`/`--restrict-eval`
`primGetEnv` returns `""` UNCONDITIONALLY (primops.cc:1865-1872) → env-independent
BY CONSTRUCTION, so the key omitting env values is harmless. So:
`perturbable = TAINT_CURRENTTIME | (pure ? TAINT_GETENV : 0)`. Under `--impure`
getEnv reads the real env (not in key) → getEnv DEMOTED TO REJECT. The whole
manifest tier is honored ONLY under pure-eval (the manifest is generated/valid
only there); under `--impure` only untainted inserts.

**Q4 exact insert gate** (replaces run.cc:1871):
```
mask = topLevelTaintMask();
pure = ffi::pureEval(*state.nixEvalState) || ffi::restrictEval(*state.nixEvalState);
perturbable = TAINT_CURRENTTIME | (pure ? TAINT_GETENV : 0);
rejectBits = mask & ~perturbable;
insert  iff  rejectBits==0
        &&  ( (mask & perturbable)==0                              // untainted
              || (pure && manifestContains(manifestEntryId(...))) ) // blessed clock-stable
```
Order is load-bearing: **reject-bits FIRST** (readFile/fetch/store/impure-getEnv
dominate the manifest — TL10), **manifest LAST**, **manifestContains fails CLOSED**
(missing/unreadable/hash-mismatch/bad-signature → false).

**Q3 manifest id = SHA-256(keyBody)** where keyBody = the topLevelCacheKey bytes
MINUS the `"v3-toplevel-vN"` version tag (schema‖system‖NIX_PATH‖basePath‖source).
Refactor topLevelCacheKey → `keyBodyBytes()` helper so production lookup ==
manifest key BY CONSTRUCTION. Manifest blesses the EXACT (source,NIX_PATH,system,
basePath) tuple; coverage limit = only pre-blessed exprs get the clock-tainted win
(novel exprs fall to the sound untainted-only baseline — a coverage gap, not a
stale-result hole).

**Q5 key v3→v4** + fold `manifestContentHashHex()` (a manifest change invalidates
clock-tainted entries) + `codegenGateFingerprint()` (R4; currently ABSENT from the
top-level key — present only in the CU key primops.cc:7445; must be exposed to
run.cc). Fold both UNCONDITIONALLY (one key shape; lookup precedes eval so taint
isn't known at lookup).

**Q2 manifest certifies** currentTime-stability via >=3 ADVERSARIAL STRADDLING
clocks (not 2 — 2 can wrongly bless an `if currentTime>T` source; TL8). Extend
bench/toplevel-cache-coverage.sh to emit a SIGNED manifest of sources byte-stable
across all points; the generator's refuse-to-bless-unstable IS the sole soundness
gate for clock-tainted entries (runtime trusts the manifest). Add a getEnv-sentinel
pass as a generation-time leak cross-check.

**Q6 M5.name/A3: CONFIRMED** getFlake→TAINT_FETCH→reject until A3 keys the flake
lock. A3 must add to the key: resolved-NIX_PATH content-ids (replace the raw
NIX_PATH env string — the R2 mutable-channel gap), flake-lock rev/narHash, and
codegenGateFingerprint; then getFlake taint can demote reject→keyed. Until A3,
M5.name reject is SOUND. **A1 full SHIP gate is COUPLED with A3** for the M5.name
leg AND for mutable-NIX_PATH robustness (R2 ship-blocker: A1 on a mutable channel
is UNSOUND; pinned/immutable archive-URL NIX_PATH is fine → A1-alone can SHIP the
pinned hello/firefox.drvPath leg).

**Q7 tests (TL7-TL12, in --brute core), test hook `NIX_V3_TOPLEVEL_MANIFEST=<path>`
(inline retirement: retire when the production manifest path is wired):**
- TL7 (+) manifest-blessed clock-independent source caches+reuses byte-id (pure-eval).
- **TL8 (− CRUX, failing-first): a clock-DEPENDENT source (`if currentTime>1.5e9…`)
  wrongly blessed by a 2-clock manifest is ACCEPTED (red); the >=3-adversarial-clock
  generator REFUSES to bless it (green). Proves >=3 straddling points is load-bearing.**
- TL9 (−) getEnv under `--impure` rejected despite manifest (mode-dependent perturbable).
- TL10 (−) readFile hard-reject dominates a wrongful manifest bless (reject-bits-first).
- TL11 (−) v3 entry NOT served by v4 (version-tag keyspace partition).
- TL12 (R) manifest swap M1→M2 = miss then hit (manifest-hash-in-key invalidation).

**Residual soundness risks (ranked, with mitigations):** R1 FFI-leaf ambient reads
below the primop boundary (HIGH — audit the 11 bump sites + derivationStrict/
writeDerivation; getEnv-sentinel catches env leaks; pure-eval bounds the surface);
R2 mutable NIX_PATH (HIGH — deferred to A3, ship-blocker for mutable channels;
pinned OK); R3 tryEval taint-non-restore (LOW, safe over-approx); R4 codegen
non-determinism (MED — codegenGateFingerprint in key + shadow mismatch==0 gate);
R5 IFD reads (MED — go through readFile→TAINT_READFILE→reject, confirmed); R6
__currentTime in drv (NONE — writeDerivation embeds no timestamp, store paths are
content-hash; confirms the empirical 98% clock-stability is structural); R7
manifest fail-open (HIGH if mishandled — fail CLOSED + sign + verify + hash-in-key);
R8 corpus coverage gap (LOW — perf not soundness; ensure SHIP workloads are in corpus).

**SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT INVARIANT:** gate checks reject-bits FIRST, manifest LAST,
fails CLOSED, honors the manifest ONLY under `--pure-eval`; the manifest's validity
rests ENTIRELY on the offline generator's >=3-adversarial-point perturbation refusing
to bless any moving result. TL8 keeps that honest.

**BUILD STATUS:** spec vetted; mechanism NOT yet built. Remaining = keyBodyBytes
refactor + expose codegenGateFingerprint + v4 + manifest loader (fail-closed) +
Q4 gate + harness manifest-emit (>=3 clocks) + TL7-TL12 + `--brute` + shadow
mismatch==0 + darwin-4 T_hit/T_eval<=0.20 → SHIP (pinned .drvPath) / DEFER-to-A3
(M5.name + mutable NIX_PATH).

## A1 VERDICT (2026-07-06) — mechanism SHIPPED (sound + tested); real-workload SHIP = **DEFER to A3**
The sound insert-gate (reject-set + offline clock-stability manifest, Q4) is BUILT
+ TESTED + committed: keyBodyBytes refactor, v3→v4, codegenGateFingerprint +
manifest-content-hash folded into the key (run.cc topLevelCacheKey), a fail-CLOSED
manifest loader (`namespace toplevel_manifest`, `NIX_V3_TOPLEVEL_MANIFEST` hook),
the Q4 gate (reject-bits FIRST, manifest LAST, `perturbable = CURRENTTIME | (pure ?
GETENV : 0)`), and TL7-TL12 (26 assertions, in `--brute` core, 35/35 GREEN). TL7
DEMONSTRATES the mechanism: a blessed clock-stable source (`builtins.seq
builtins.currentTime "stable"`) gets a cross-process byte-id ACTIVE HIT under
`--pure-eval`. Gate soundness independently confirmed: reject-bits-first (TL10),
getEnv-under-impure-rejected (TL9), fail-closed on malformed manifest, manifest-hash
keyspace partition (TL11/TL12).

**But the SHIP-gate REAL WORKLOADS (hello/firefox.drvPath) are STRUCTURALLY BLOCKED
without A3 — an EMPIRICAL discovery from building it:**
- The manifest tier is honored ONLY under `--pure-eval` (to bound R1, the untainted-
  ambient-impurity surface — this is the soundness contract, NOT loosenable without
  re-exposing R1; "never weaken a gate").
- **`--pure-eval` forbids `<nixpkgs>` search-paths** (`cannot look up '<nixpkgs>' in
  pure evaluation mode`) **AND explicit absolute/store-path imports** (`access to
  absolute path '…-source' is forbidden in pure evaluation mode`) — VERIFIED both.
- ⇒ under pure-eval the ONLY route to pinned nixpkgs is a **flake** (getFlake / a
  flake input), which is `TAINT_FETCH` → hard-reject until A3 keys the flake-lock.
- ⇒ the coupling is BROADER than the spec's M5.name-only finding: **EVERY pinned-
  nixpkgs .drvPath workload is coupled to A3**, because pure-eval ⟹ flakes ⟹ A3.
  Under `--impure` the manifest tier is off by design (getEnv reads real env) →
  currentTime-tainted .drvPath is rejected there too.

**DISPOSITION: A1 mechanism = SHIPPED sound foundation (default-off, brute-clean,
byte-id inert without a manifest); A1 real-workload SHIP = DEFER, gated on A3.**
A3 (resolved-NIX_PATH content-ids + flake-lock rev + codegenGateFingerprint into
the key, demoting getFlake FETCH-taint → keyed) is now the CRITICAL-PATH unblocker
for A1's SHIP gate — not an optional follow-on. Once A3 lands, a flake-pinned
nixpkgs evals under pure-eval, getFlake becomes keyed (not tainted), and the
manifest tier serves hello/firefox.drvPath → the SHIP gate becomes demonstrable
(cross-process byte-id HIT + shadow mismatch==0 + T_hit/T_eval≤0.20).

## A3 VETTED IMPLEMENTATION SPEC (2026-07-06, opus adversarial pass) — flake-lock + resolved-NIX_PATH keying
Resolves the pre-eval-key vs during-eval-lock tension. DECISIVE facts: (1) the v3
top-level cache fires ONLY for `--expr`/`--file` (installable `path:#attr` → TW
fallback), so a flake ref is ALWAYS a literal string in `source`; (2)
`ffi::lockFlakeAndRead(state, ref, pure)` is pre-eval-computable + idempotent +
returns `lockFileStr` = the FULL flake.lock text = a complete immutable lock
identity (under pure-eval it REJECTS unlocked refs); it is an FFI call → bumps NO
taint; (3) getFlake bumps TAINT_FETCH (bit 3) today = the A1 SHIP blocker.

**CHOSEN: option (a)∩(c)** — pre-eval lock resolution RESTRICTED to statically-
extractable literal refs. Reject (b) two-phase (coarse-lookup + post-eval-verify
BREAKS skip-on-hit — the whole point is skipping eval; can't make the pre-eval
lookup sound). (a) alone risks parse-fragility on computed refs; (c) makes the
non-literal case fall back to today's sound hard-reject.

1. **Resolved-NIX_PATH (stated A3 gate).** Replace the raw `getenv("NIX_PATH")`
   string in keyBodyBytes with resolved content-ids via a NEW read-only FFI
   `resolveNixPathContentIds(state)` (`resolveLookupPathPath`, initAccessControl=
   FALSE — must not allowPath/mutate): archive-URL-with-rev → URL verbatim (sound);
   store path / channel symlink → `resolveSymlinks()`→store-path hash (SOUND, closes
   R2 mutable-channel — a channel update changes the target hash → key changes →
   MISS-not-stale); working-tree dir → realpath only (BEST-EFFORT, gated). Companion
   strictly-sound fix: add `topLevelTaintBump(TAINT_READFILE)` to primFindFile
   (~primops.cc:3143) — a `<x>` lookup reads ambient FS → any search-path-consuming
   --impure eval rejects unless store-addressed.
2. **Flake-lock keying (the A1-SHIP unblocker, HARD part).**
   - NEW axis `TAINT_GETFLAKE = 1u<<5` (primop.hh); primGetFlake (primops.cc:10429)
     bumps GETFLAKE not FETCH. fetchTree/Tarball/Closure/Git/storePath STAY FETCH
     (non-locked → hard-reject, never demoted).
   - Pre-parse STATIC literal-ref extraction from `source`: match `builtins.getFlake
     "<ref>"` / `getFlake "<ref>"` where <ref> is a plain double-quoted literal (NO
     `${}` interpolation, NO `\` escapes, NO `'' ''`); an occurrence-count GUARD
     (extracted-literals ≥ coarse `getFlake` token count, else REJECT) catches the
     `let g=builtins.getFlake; in g "…"` alias miss. Over-reject = safe; under-extract
     = unsound → the guard forbids it.
   - For each extracted ref: `ffi::lockFlakeAndRead(state, ref, pure)` INSIDE
     keyBodyBytes; append `ref ‖ lockFileStr` to the key. ANY failure (unlocked-in-
     pure, parse err, dirty input) → `flakeKeyingFailed` → NOT cacheable (fail closed).
   - DEMOTION (Q4 gate extension): `keyedDemotable = flakeLockFullyKeyed ? TAINT_GETFLAKE
     : 0; rejectBits = mask & ~(perturbable | keyedDemotable)`. GETFLAKE cleared from
     reject ONLY when the exact lock is in the key ⇒ a flake.lock change → different
     lockFileStr → different key → MISS-not-stale; a non-extractable getFlake →
     flakeLockFullyKeyed=false → GETFLAKE stays reject → hard reject. LOAD-BEARING
     INVARIANT: **demote iff keyed, else reject.** Lookup-key (run.cc:1940) + insert-
     key MUST both use the identical keyBodyBytes (they do — preserve it).
   - Dirty flake input → lockFlake (pure, allowUnlocked=false) throws → reject; +belt:
     any node with dirtyRev/dirtyShortRev → flakeKeyingFailed → reject.
3. **A1 manifest interaction.** A flake-pinned .drvPath (pure) → mask =
   GETFLAKE|CURRENTTIME → GETFLAKE demoted (keyed), CURRENTTIME still flows through
   A1's manifest bless (offline ≥3-clock). manifestEntryId auto-incorporates the new
   key body (lock + resolved-NIX_PATH) → the generator blesses the exact (source,
   NIX_PATH, system, basePath, flake-lock) tuple. SHIP demonstrable for M5.name/HNE +
   FLAKE-PINNED-rephrased hello/firefox.drvPath; the raw `<nixpkgs>` search-path
   phrasing under pure-eval stays structurally impossible (must rephrase to a flake).
4. **Version v4→v5** (key inputs + insert policy change; a v4 entry served by v5 =
   poisoning). Manifest must be REGENERATED for v5 (old ids fail closed → reject).
5. **Tests TL13-TL18 (--brute core), TL15 = failing-first CRUX:** TL13 same-pin HIT;
   TL14 diff-pin MISS; **TL15 (−) mutate flake.lock in place (source unchanged) →
   MUST MISS-not-stale** (RED if keyed only on source); TL16 dirty-flake-input reject;
   TL17 (−) mutable-symlink retarget MISS-not-stale (R2); TL18 (R) cross-pin round-trip.
   Hook `V3_DBG_TOPLEVEL_FLAKEKEY` (retirement-noted).
6. **RANKED RISKS:** A3-R1 (HIGH, THE dangerous surface) — static literal-ref
   extraction unsoundness (mis-extract/miss a ref) → **must be adversarially FUZZED**
   (getFlake in comments/string-bodies, `let`-alias, `builtins.` vs bare); mitigated
   by conservative matcher + count-guard + fail-closed default. A3-R2 computed ref
   (reject). A3-R3 best-effort working-tree NIX_PATH (taint-gated). A3-R4 lock-twice
   non-determinism (pure-eval useRegistries=false deterministic; prefer demote-only-
   when-pure). A3-R5 transitive input mutability (lockFileStr includes all narHashes →
   sound). A3-R6 --apply boundary (each leg keyed independently).
   **HONEST T_hit CAVEAT:** an ACTIVE hit now pays the key-time lockFlake cost →
   T_hit/T_eval≤0.20 MUST be re-measured on darwin-4 for flake workloads (lockFlake on
   a cheap `.name` query may not clear the bar even when byte-id correct). = the A3
   SHIP go/no-go, an empirical darwin-4 measurement.

**BUILD STATUS:** A3 spec vetted; NOT built. This build is LARGE + high-soundness-
risk (A3-R1 matcher needs a fuzz pass) → a focused fresh-context build with the
mandated adversarial fuzzing of the ref-matcher, NOT a tail-of-session rush.
