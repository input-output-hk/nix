# Path B Investigation — 2026-05-16

User picked Path B (action plan Phase 2): "finish CELL_EVERYWHERE,
fix the lib.fix outer-x case, retire THUNK_ALL".  This doc records
the investigation state.

## Cycle source isolated

The repro `builtins.isAttrs (import <nixpkgs>{})` under
`NIX_V3_NO_INHERIT_FROM_THUNK_ALL=1 + NIX_V3_CELL_EVERYWHERE=1`:

  - Time: 0.6 s (no longer the 44 s hot loop)
  - Error: `v3 OP_WITH_LOOKUP: cycle while resolving 'libsForQt5'`
  - Position: `pkgs/top-level/stage.nix:150:7`
  - With-stack at fire: `with[0] = Tag::Slot → Tag::Thunk (state=1
    Blackhole)`

stage.nix:150 is the `allPackages` fix-point continuation:

```nix
allPackages = self: super:
  let
    res = import ./all-packages.nix { ... } res self super;
    conflictingAttrs = lib.intersectAttrs res super;
  in
  assert lib.assertMsg (conflictingAttrs == { }) ...;
  res;
```

`res` is the fix-point of all-packages applied to itself.  The
`with self;` look-up of `libsForQt5` fires inside all-packages.nix
while `res`'s outer thunk is Black.

## Frame stack at cycle (V3_DBG_WITH_CYCLE=1)

```
[93] thunk 'res' codeOff=454 EXEC=super     ← allPackages' res
[92] thunk 'conflictingAttrs' codeOff=513
[91] <thunk> codeOff=529
[90] call 'msg' codeOff=148
[89] call 'super' codeOff=398
[88] thunk 'prev' codeOff=183 EXEC=final    ← lib.extends's prev
[87] thunk 'prev' codeOff=183 EXEC=final
[86] thunk 'prev' codeOff=183 EXEC=final
[85] thunk 'prev' codeOff=183 EXEC=final
[84] thunk 'prev' codeOff=183 EXEC=final
[83] call 'final' codeOff=148               ← lib.extends's final lambda
[82] thunk 'x' codeOff=205                  ← lib.fix's x = f x
```

Five `prev` frames stacked — the overlay-composition cascade.
The cycle source is the chain `lib.fix x → final → prev → ... →
allPackages res → conflictingAttrs → with self; libsForQt5`.

## Why CELL_EVERYWHERE alone doesn't help

Per the existing infrastructure (commit `20adafe31` / Phase 1.5):

1. shapeCell-write fires at OP_ATTRS_REC_INIT[_TAIL] and
   OP_ATTRS_UPDATE_TAIL on the **innermost** `CFF_THUNK_RETURN`
   frame.
2. shapeCell-read fires in `forceValue`'s Black branch.

For `let x = f x` in lib.fix:
  - `x`'s body is `f x` — a function call, not an attrset literal.
  - Inside `f`'s body, `prev // overlay final prev` fires
    OP_ATTRS_UPDATE_TAIL.  But the **innermost** `CFF_THUNK_RETURN`
    at that moment is `prev` (frame 88), not `x` (frame 82).
  - So `prev->shapeCell` is updated; `x->shapeCell` stays at the
    sentinel `Tag::Thunk(x)`.

When OP_WITH_LOOKUP forces the with-source (which is `x`):
  - forceValue's Black-branch shapeCell-recovery checks
    `shapeVal.tag() == Tag::Thunk && shapeVal.payload.thunk == x` —
    yes, still the sentinel.  Recovery doesn't fire.
  - BlackholeError thrown.

So: `count of shapeCell-recovery events under V3_DBG_CELL_EVERYWHERE
on the repro: 0`.

## Why "cross-thunk propagation" was rejected

Per `CELL_UPDATE_EVERYWHERE_2026-05-12.md` §"Why not the cross-thunk
hack?" — propagating shapeCell up the THUNK_RETURN chain was tried
(Phase 1.5b, reverted) and broke things:

  > Writing the same inner Bindings to all outer thunks' shapeCells
  > means an outer thunk's "value" is observed as the inner Bindings,
  > even though the outer's eventual value is something else (the //
  > of the inner with other contributions).

So: cross-thunk propagation is NOT a valid Path B move.

## Synthetic does NOT reproduce

A minimal `fix (extends overlay (final: {...with final; pkgA...}))`
synthetic works on ALL paths (TW, default v3, NO_THUNK_ALL +
CELL_EVERYWHERE).  The bug requires structural complexity beyond
2-overlay lib.fix + with-self-lookup.

## 2026-05-17 — TW-side instrumentation lands the hypothesis kill

Added `TW_DBG_WITH_NAME=<symbol>` gate to `src/libexpr/eval.cc`
`lookupVar`: when set, logs every with-lookup of the named symbol
with the with-source's current type-tag.  Counterpart to v3's
existing `V3_DBG_WITH_CYCLE`.

Measurement on `(import <nixpkgs>{}).hello.name` AND on
`builtins.isAttrs (import <nixpkgs>{})`:

  - TW: **zero** with-lookups for `libsForQt5`.  The look-up that
    cycles v3 never fires under TW at all.
  - v3 (NO_THUNK_ALL): single look-up firing inside `res` thunk's
    `super`-executing closure, with-source is a Black slot.

**Hypothesis killed**: "TW also fires the same `with self;
libsForQt5` look-up and handles it gracefully via some mechanism
v3 lacks."  FALSE.  TW never reaches the look-up.  v3 is forcing
something eagerly that TW defers.

Per LESSONS_LEARNED §1.3 ("Eager-vs-lazy asymmetry is the dominant
bug class"): the Path B fix is to find the v3-side eager force and
make it lazy in `lower.cc`, matching TW.

## Where to look — narrowed targets

The cycle stack:
  [93] thunk `res` codeOff=454 EXEC=super
  [92] thunk `conflictingAttrs` codeOff=513
  [91] anon `<thunk>` codeOff=529
  [90] call `msg` codeOff=148
  [89] call `super` codeOff=398

Frame 93 IS inside res's body (with EXEC=super, meaning the closure
currently dispatched is named "super").  The with-stack at fire is
a single source — the `with pkgs;` from `all-packages.nix:29`.

`with pkgs;` at the top of `all-packages.nix` is the look-up
scope: any unresolved name in res's body falls through to pkgs
(=fixpoint).  Under TW, res's outer attrset construction does not
fire the look-up; under v3, something DOES.

Most likely v3 culprits:
  (a) An attrset entry in res that v3 emits non-thunked but TW
      defers via `maybeThunk`.  Audit `lowerAttrs` -> `thunkifyForAttr`
      -> `isTrivialForLazy` for any AST shape that's currently
      classified as "trivial" but contains a `fromWith` reference
      transitively.
  (b) An `inherit` clause without `(from ...)` where the inherited
      name has `fromWith=true` but v3 emits an eager `OP_GET_LOCAL`
      via a path that bypasses `thunkifyForAttr`.
  (c) A let-binding in res's body that v3 forces eagerly (e.g.
      pure-call recognized by isTrivialForLazy(forArg=true)) but
      whose body resolves `with pkgs;`.

## 2026-05-17 — Bytecode site of the cycle

`V3_DBG_WITH_CYCLE=1 V3_DBG_OPCYCLE_DISASM=1` dumps the bytecode
window around the firing OP.  At ip=34289 inside the `super`-named
closure (desc.codeOff=140):

```
[34288] OP_SET_LOCAL     operand=3274
[34289] OP_WITH_LOOKUP   operand=24029           ← cycle fires
[34290] OP_ATTRS_SELECT  operand=1987 (callPackage)
[34292] OP_LIT_PATH      operand=4
[34293] OP_CALL          operand=0
```

The pattern is `libsForQt5.callPackage <path>` — `OP_WITH_LOOKUP`
resolves `libsForQt5` via the `with pkgs;` scope at
`all-packages.nix:29`, then `.callPackage`, then call with a
literal path.

The firing op is INSIDE a closure named `super` (the convention
for overlay-style `super: ...` parameter).  The `super` closure
runs when its containing overlay is applied during the lib.fix
fixpoint construction.

**Narrowed culprit class**: v3 forces some attribute eagerly whose
body invokes `super`.  TW defers that attribute's force; v3
doesn't.  The bug is at the SITE OF THE EAGER FORCE OF THAT
ATTRIBUTE, not at the `super` closure or the `libsForQt5.callPackage`
expression itself (both are correctly lowered).

## Outstanding: which attribute is force-eagerly?

The cycle stack [82..93] traverses:
  x (lib.fix) → final → 5×prev (extends chain) → super →
  msg → conflictingAttrs's anon thunk → conflictingAttrs → res

`conflictingAttrs = lib.intersectAttrs res super` is the only
non-thunked computation at this layer of stage.nix.  But its
primop body forces both args to WHNF (attrset), which is fine —
that's just OUTER shape, no inner value force.

The 5×prev frames are EXEC=final (overlay-composition's `final:
let prev = f final; in prev // overlay final prev`).  Each prev
forces all-packages's output to attrset, also fine.

The eager FORCE that fires the with-lookup must be deeper.  Next
session: instrument OP_FORCE / forceValue with a name+pos filter
matching `libsForQt5` or `super` to find which higher-level frame
fires the chain.

## What rules out

- **Hypothesis killed**: "the libsForQt5 look-up site itself is
  badly lowered."  The bytecode at code 34289 is CORRECT —
  `OP_WITH_LOOKUP libsForQt5; OP_ATTRS_SELECT callPackage;
  OP_LIT_PATH; OP_CALL`.  That's exactly the right shape for
  `libsForQt5.callPackage path`.  The bug is the WHO is firing
  the super closure, not WHAT the super closure does.

## 2026-05-17 — Root cause fully localized

Extended V3_DBG_WITH_CYCLE to dump ALL frames + cu->stringConstants.
Combined with the existing V3_DBG_INHERIT_FROM_THUNK gate, the
cycle source is now a SINGLE source line in nixpkgs and a SINGLE
gated code path in v3's lowerer.

**Nixpkgs source line** (the firing FROM_EXPR):

  `pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix:7385`:
  ```nix
  inherit (libsForQt5.callPackage ../development/libraries/wt { })
    wt4
    ;
  ```

  The path `../development/libraries/wt` matches
  `cu->stringConstants[4]` (operand of the firing `OP_LIT_PATH`
  at bytecode offset 34292).

**V3 lowerer decision** (the gated code path):

  `lower.cc:1955-1962` — `isComplexFromExpr`'s "Call on Select on
  Var" case for `libsForQt5.callPackage path`:

  ```cpp
  if (head && head->exprKind == nix::Expr::Kind::Select) {
      auto * sel = static_cast<nix::ExprSelect *>(head);
      if (sel->e && sel->e->exprKind == nix::Expr::Kind::Var) {
          static const bool s_callOnSelectVar =
              std::getenv("NIX_V3_THUNK_CALL_ON_SELECT_VAR") != nullptr;
          if (s_callOnSelectVar) return true;   // ← gated OFF by default
      }
  }
  ```

  `V3_DBG_INHERIT_FROM_THUNK=1` confirms line 7385's FROM_EXPR is
  decided `EAGER` under default flags.  Line 7389 (the next
  `inherit (callPackages ../xapian { })` clause) is decided
  `THUNK` because its head is a Var, not a Select-on-Var.

**Why the gate is OFF**:

  The existing comment at lower.cc:1944-1954 explains it best:

  > GATED behind NIX_V3_THUNK_CALL_ON_SELECT_VAR because enabling
  > it default-on triggered a runtime force-count explosion (~6M
  > forces of lib/systems/parse.nix:64 in 30s) — the broader
  > thunkify breaks TW's sharing of lib.systems.* computations
  > under v3's freeVar-capture semantics.  Same bug class as
  > project_498 always-thunkify regression: the thunk wrap's
  > upvalue capture doesn't propagate the same memoization that
  > TW's env-driven thunks do.

**The complete picture**:

| flag combo | wt4 FROM_EXPR | hello.name result |
|---|---|---|
| THUNK_ALL=on (default), CALL_ON_SELECT_VAR=off | thunk | 5.7M setType hot loop, 44s timeout |
| THUNK_ALL=off, CALL_ON_SELECT_VAR=off | EAGER | OP_WITH_LOOKUP cycle, 0.6s |
| THUNK_ALL=off, CALL_ON_SELECT_VAR=on | thunk | (same 6M force explosion, per existing comment) |

All three paths hit the same 100× slowdown via different routes.

**The actual root bug** (the action plan's Path B real target):

The thunk wrap for a thunkified inherit-from FROM_EXPR captures
its freeVars/upvalues at MK_THUNK time.  The captures are VALUE
COPIES (or Tag::Slot pointers), not env-slot references like TW
uses.  When TW forces a thunk over `lib.systems.parse`, the env
slot for `parse` gets mutated in-place; the thunk's body sees the
mutation.  Subsequent thunks built later inherit the SAME slot
(via env-chain sharing), so all share the cpuTypes attrset.

In v3, each thunkified FROM_EXPR allocates its own thunk with its
own captured upvalues.  Even if the underlying values point to
the same `lib.systems` Bindings, the FORCE of each thunk
re-evaluates the body, which (because of how rec-attrset entries
are accessed via OP_ATTRS_SELECT IC writeback that's
per-attrset-instance) doesn't share the work.  Result: cpuTypes
gets rebuilt per FROM_EXPR force.

**Path B's real architectural fix**:

The fix is at v3's freeVar/upvalue capture protocol, not at
`Thunk::shapeCell` cross-thunk propagation (the action plan's
Phase B as written).  Specifically:

  - Make thunkified inherit-from FROM_EXPR thunks share storage
    with the surrounding scope's let-rec slots.  When two FROM_EXPR
    thunks both reference `lib.systems.parse`, they should both
    deref the SAME `parse` slot (Tag::Slot pointing to the same
    parent Value cell).  Forcing one of them updates the slot;
    the other sees the updated value automatically.
  - That requires propagating Tag::Slot semantics down through
    `thunkifyForAttr` -> `thunkify` -> the per-Function freeVar
    list, so the thunk body's OP_GET_UPVALUE reads via the shared
    slot pointer instead of a copied Value.

This is a real but bounded architectural change.  ~3-5 days of
work per CELL_UPDATE_EVERYWHERE-style estimates.

## Next concrete commit candidates

1. **Add a smaller `repro-wt-cycle.nix` fixture** that uses just
   the `inherit (libsForQt5.callPackage path { }) wt4` pattern in
   isolation — should reproduce the cycle without all of nixpkgs.
2. **Audit v3's MK_THUNK freeVar capture**: identify where the
   upvalue is captured as a Value (copy) vs Tag::Slot (sharing).
3. **Prototype Tag::Slot propagation through thunkifyForAttr**:
   when the body's freeVar resolves to a let-rec slot, capture as
   Tag::Slot; otherwise capture as Value.





How does TW resolve `with self; libsForQt5` while self is mid-
construction in `lib.fix (extends ... allPackages)`?

Candidate hypotheses:

  1. **TW publishes x's value earlier than v3.**  When `f`'s body
     terminates, TW writes the result to x's Value cell.  If this
     happens BEFORE the `with self; libsForQt5` look-up fires, TW
     observes x as Evaluated.
  2. **TW's `with` is bind-at-push, not lookup-at-deref.**  At
     `with self;` push time, TW snapshots self's bindings; lookups
     hit the snapshot without re-forcing self.
  3. **TW publishes intermediate `//` results via the lvalue chain.**
     TW's `mkAttrs` writes to `*v`, the parent's slot.  Each `//`
     in `prev // overlay final prev` might publish progressively.
  4. **The lookup never fires under TW** because TW's lazy eval
     defers `pkgs.libsForQt5` access until after the fixpoint has
     settled.

Without confirming WHICH, Path B can't pick a correct architectural
move.  The next concrete action: instrument TW with a counterpart
to V3_DBG_WITH_CYCLE, run hello.name, observe whether the same
look-up fires and what TW does that v3 doesn't.

## What this rules out

- **Hypothesis killed**: "Turning on NIX_V3_CELL_EVERYWHERE
  closes the libsForQt5 cycle alone."  FALSE — shapeCell never gets
  populated for the relevant outer thunk.
- **Hypothesis killed**: "Cross-thunk shapeCell propagation is the
  Path B fix."  FALSE — already tried and reverted (Phase 1.5b);
  semantically wrong.
- **Hypothesis killed**: "Synthetic 2-overlay lib.fix + with-self-
  lookup reproduces the bug."  FALSE — synthetic works everywhere;
  the bug requires structural complexity beyond it.

## What remains open

Path B's real fix depends on the open question above.  Until then,
the action plan's "Path B" name is not yet wired to a concrete
implementation.

The narrow positive: the cycle source is well-localized (single
`with self; libsForQt5` at stage.nix:150 during allPackages res
construction).  The Path B work needs to either:

  (a) Eliminate the eager force that makes the look-up fire mid-
      construction (CELL_UPDATE_EVERYWHERE plan §"Why not the
      cross-thunk hack?": "ensure no thunk is forced while it's
      mid-construction"), OR
  (b) Add a TW-style mechanism v3 doesn't have today (per the open
      question's resolution).

## Repro state

`test/repro-hello-name.nix` + `test/run-hello-name-repro.sh`
encode the gate-bisection.  This doc adds the cycle's exact
location + the architectural blockers.  Phase 2 next session:
investigate TW's behavior on the same `with self;` lookup.

## 2026-05-17 falsification — Select-chain `isComplexFromExpr`

**Hypothesis tested**: "v3's `isComplexFromExpr` only matches
depth-1 Select-on-Var (`inherit (lib.systems) X`), so deeper chains
like `inherit (lib.systems.parse) X` fall through to EAGER lowering.
Walking the Select chain up to N hops and accepting any chain
rooted in Var should match TW's blanket `from->maybeThunk` and
close the hot loop on parsedPlatform.check."

**Change applied (then reverted)**: in `src/libexpr-v3/lower.cc`
`isComplexFromExpr`, replaced the single-step `sel->e->Var` check
with an up-to-8-hop Select-walk to the head, accepting `head->Var`.

**Outcome**:
- Build clean; `v3-iterative-force-depth` and
  `v3-let-rec-publish-split` regression tests pass.
- `bench.py --modes tw,v3-direct -n 5` flags
  `lib-mapAttrs-100`: tw -5.5% (noise / improvement); and
  `lib-strings-ops`: v3-direct **+6.2% REGRESSION** — extending
  Select-chain thunkification penalizes lib/strings.nix workloads
  that previously lowered EAGER without harm.
- `(import <nixpkgs>{}).hello.name` still times out at ~85 s
  with the **same 5.77M setType / 4.02M flip / 3.6M mkOptionType.check
  hot-loop alloc pattern** documented in
  `~/.claude-io/.../project_583_memoization_loop.md`.

**Hypothesis killed**: "extending `isComplexFromExpr` to walk
Select chains rooted in Var fixes the parsedPlatform.check hot
loop."  FALSE — the deeper-chain thunkification rule changes
**which** sites are thunkified, but does not change the **shape
of the cycle** at parse.nix:953 (`mkSystem` → parsedPlatform.check).
The hot loop is invariant under inherit-from thunkification granularity.

**Implication**: the cycle's amplification factor (~3000 deep, 1M+
mkSystem calls for a single package) is NOT caused by under-
thunkification of `inherit (lib.systems.parse) ...`.  It is in:
- (i) `flip` re-entry inside `enum.check` / `setTypes` cycle, or
- (ii) `attrValues cpuTypes` re-evaluation (per-call rather than
      once at lib-init), or
- (iii) `_type` field force triggering setType re-execution via a
       v3-specific cell-write hook.

Memory `project_583_memoization_loop.md` rules out (ii) at N=100
via synthetic probe.  Next session should test (i) and (iii)
*before* trying further lowering-rule edits.

**Working tree**: revert applied (`git checkout
src/libexpr-v3/lower.cc`).  No uncommitted code change.

## 2026-05-17 root cause — Tag::App-no-writeback (commit 189497b81)

After ruling out the lowering-rule hypothesis above, the real root
cause turned out to be in primops, not in lower.cc.

**Re-framing the 2026-05-16 "not a memoization bug" claim**: that
falsification used a synthetic probe with trivial mapAttrs lambda
bodies (`{}`).  A faithful probe with builtins.trace shows the gap:

```
let
  mapped = builtins.mapAttrs (n: v: builtins.trace "FORCE-${n}" v) {a=0;b=1;c=2;};
  values = builtins.attrValues mapped;
  needle = -1;
  result = builtins.foldl' (acc: i: acc + (if builtins.elem needle values then 1 else 0)) 0
    (builtins.genList (i: i) 4);
in result
```

- TW: 3 FORCE traces (cached after first iteration).
- v3-direct: 15 FORCE traces (re-evaluates on every elem call).

The trivial-body probe hid this because re-evaluating `{}` 100× is
~free.  Real mapAttrs lambdas (setTypes' assert+setType, e.g.) cost
serious work per re-evaluation.

**Actual root cause**: v3's `forceValue(VMState&, Value v)` takes
`Value` BY VALUE.  primElem iterates `src->elems[i]` of a list of
Tag::App entries (from primMapAttrs / primGenList).  forceValue
resolves the App locally and returns the WHNF, but the caller's
list slot is never updated.  TW's `forceValue(Value & v)` mutates
through the reference; TW's list elements are `Value *` shared with
bindings entries, so forces memoize via the pointer.

**Fix (commit 189497b81)**: in primElem, take the list slot by
lvalue reference and force through it.  Subsequent elem-calls on
the same list see cached WHNFs.

**Validation**:
- Synthetic: 15 → 3 forces (TW parity).
- 143/143 cutover-parity lang tests pass.
- Bench (-n 5 against 2026-05-15 baseline): no v3-direct cell
  regresses > 5%.
- **Real nixpkgs `builtins.isAttrs (import <nixpkgs>{})`** with
  NIX_V3_SKIP_INSTALLABLE_PREEVAL=1 + NIX_V3_LOG_DEPTH=1:
  baseline 65.96 s → with fix 27.35 s = **2.41× speedup**.
  (Both reach vm.frames depth=5000 peak; the win is in per-call
  cost, not depth reduction.)

## Open: A12b — vm.frames depth=5000 stack overflow

After the primElem fix, `(import <nixpkgs>{})` still SIGSEGVs
(rc=139) without LOG_DEPTH on.  Both baseline and fix reach
kMaxCallDepth (5000); without LOG_DEPTH, the C-stack overflows
before the v3-level throw can unwind cleanly.

This is a pre-existing architectural issue (commit 189497b81's
comment notes it).  Direct-forceValue call sites in callClosure /
valueEqual / primop helpers C-recurse where TW iterates.  The
iterative-force refactor only converted opcode-level forces, not
helper-level forces.  See
`ITERATIVE_FORCE_AUDIT_2026-05-18.md` (callClosure primop-arg
loop already done as B1) for the audit.

Next: pick the highest-impact remaining direct-forceValue site
(probably callClosure's `fun` force, line 9626, or valueEqual's
recursive list/attrs entries) and convert to iterative.  Defer
the valueEqual/valueLess inner-writeback variant of the primElem
fix until this is resolved (they were stashed for the same reason).

Candidate writebacks (in vm.cc) that build clean + pass lang tests
but hit the depth-5000 crash without the iterative-force work:
- `valueEqual` case Tag::List: writeback `la/lb->elems[i]`.
- `valueEqual` case Tag::Attrs: writeback `aa/bb->entries[i].value`.
- `valueLess` case List: writeback list elements.

All three are mechanical writeback transforms of the same form as
primElem.  Land them after the recursion bound is fixed.

## 2026-05-17 (later) — A12b architectural step 1: OP_CALL fun-force

Commit `7f5a392f4` converts OP_CALL's `fun` force from C-recursive
`forceValue(vm, fun)` to the iterative `op_force_slow + writeback-
slot` pattern (the same one used by OP_NOT / OP_AND_BRANCH /
OP_LIST_CONCAT et al.).

The conversion preserves the Tag::Thunk fast path (one-hop chase
in-place when the evaluated value is WHNF) and routes only the
non-WHNF cases (Tag::App, Tag::Slot, Suspended/non-fast Thunk)
through the iterative path.  Validation: 143/143 cutover lang
tests + 7/7 A12 cache + iter-force tests pass.

Test `test/repro-a12b-op-call-iter-force.nix` (POS-4) exercises:
  - tripleResult = fns.triple 14 where fns is a primMapAttrs result
    (fun is Tag::App): expect 42.
  - doubleResult = fns.double 7: expect 14.
  - accResult = foldl' (acc: f: f acc) 0 (attrValues bumps) over
    200 mapAttrs-built lambdas: expect 19900.

**Caveat**: hello.name's depth=5000 crash is NOT fixed by this
single conversion, because the deep eval chain in stdenv.mkDerivation
has `fun=Closure` (already WHNF) in the hot path — the iterative
force only fires on Tag::App / non-Evaluated Thunk.  The
C-recursive depth comes from OTHER call sites (callClosure's
fun-force, valueEqual's pre-force, OP_CALL's primop-arg loop)
which weren't converted in this commit.  See
`memory/project_a12b_depth5000.md` for the remaining open
conversions and architectural blockers.
