# v3 repro fixture manifest

Per-fixture index: file → lesson it pins → original issue/commit.

This file is the source of truth for `test/run-repros.sh` (the automated
runner) and the human reference when investigating new bugs ("did we
ever see this shape before?").

Convention: every `repro-<topic>.nix` in `test/` MUST appear here with
at least the lesson + commit columns filled in.  New repros must be
added when a bug is fixed — see `LESSONS_LEARNED_2026-05-15.md` §4.8
on the bisect → fixture → permanent-guard workflow.

| `repro-hello-name-real.nix` | Real-nixpkgs hello.name smoke (Option 4 hybrid guard) | (session 2026-05-17/18) | v3-direct vs TW oracle |
| `repro-beta-reduce.nix` | IR Phase A semantic guard (8 patterns) | (session 2026-05-18) | TW + v3 ON + v3 OFF (NIX_V3_NO_BETA_REDUCE=1) all match |

| `repro-stream-fusion.nix` | IR Phase C semantic + perf guard (foldl'+map → __foldlMap) | (session 2026-05-18) | TW + v3 ON + v3 OFF (NIX_V3_NO_STREAM_FUSION=1) all match; N=100K perf budget 5s catches PrimOpCall-shape regression (60× slowdown) |
| `repro-lambda-lift.nix` | IR Phase D semantic + alloc guard (closure-free intern) | (session 2026-05-18) | TW + v3 ON + v3 OFF (NIX_V3_NO_LAMBDA_LIFT=1) all match; N=100 alloc guard: ON saves ~99 closure allocs vs OFF (224 vs 323) |
| `repro-path-with-context-coerce.nix` | Tag::Path coerceToString → /nix/store + `__structuredAttrs` env emission | `78fa43631` (2026-05-19) | TW + v3-direct must match |
| `repro-665-tostring-vs-derivcoerce.nix` | `toString` non-copying vs new `__derivCoerce` copying; bash bootstrap cascade fix | `7b2535fc9` (2026-05-19, #665) | TW + v3-direct must match |
| `repro-666-derivation-equality.nix` | `primops.cc` `valueEqual` derivation outPath special-case (was diverging from `vm.cc` `valueEqual`) — `builtins.elem` + `lib.unique` on derivations | `45da225c6` (2026-05-19, #666) | TW + v3-direct must match |
| `repro-667-assert-force.nix` | `OP_ASSERT` CFF_FORCE_RETRY iterative-force protocol (was the only bool-consuming opcode missing it) — unblocks gtk3 / firefox-unwrapped / firefox | `120def5bc` (2026-05-19, #667) | TW + v3-direct must match |
| `repro-668-defer-across-branch.nix` | #542 emit-time deferring leaked OP_SET_LOCAL ops INSIDE then-block via flushAllDeferred-on-block-entry; else-path saw mismatched stack depth → later OP_GET_LOCAL on Uninit slot → STR_CONCAT cascade → SIGTRAP on go.drvPath | (2026-05-19, #668) | TW + v3-direct must match |
| `repro-672-tojson-context.nix` | `builtins.toJSON` lost string context for interpolated paths / derivations (lib.generators.toLua → writeText drvs missing inputDrvs); also exercises `__toString` lookup path | (2026-05-19, #672) | TW + v3-direct must match |
| `repro-673-basename-dirof-context.nix` | `baseNameOf` / `dirOf` dropped string context on String input; preserved on Path input (no context to drop). Found during #672 audit. | (2026-05-19, #673) | TW + v3-direct must match |
| `repro-674-no-ctx-primops.nix` | `parseDrvName`/`splitVersion`/`getEnv`/`compareVersions` silently accepted contexted strings (TW rejects via `forceStringNoCtx`); also `toXML` dropped context. Fix mirrors TW's exact error string for the rejection path. | (2026-05-19, #674) | TW + v3-direct must match |
| `repro-669-lambda-contextual-name.nix` | `nix eval --impure` printer emits the contextual binding name for let/attr-bound lambdas (matches TW's `«lambda foo @ pos»`); anonymous lambdas stay nameless. Plumbed via new `LambdaDescriptor::contextualName` (lower.cc reads `ExprLambda::name`). | (2026-05-19, #669 follow-up) | TW + v3-direct must match |
| `repro-670-671-ghc-sphinx-bisection.nix` | Bisection result: `haskell.compiler.{ghc96,ghc98,ghc910,ghc984}` with `enableDocs=false` produce byte-identical drvPaths to TW. Sphinx/docs is the trigger for both #670 (SIGTRAP) and #671 (fake-store fallback). | (2026-05-19, #670/#671 bisection) | TW + v3-direct must match |
| `repro-670-671-python-mismatch.nix` | Root-cause guard: ghc94/96/98/910/984 must all produce byte-identical drvPaths to TW. Pre-fix the dangling-string_view bug in primDerivationStrictNative made ghc96+ non-deterministically fail. | (2026-05-20, #670/#671 FIX) | TW + v3-direct must match |
| `repro-675-tojson-shortcircuit.nix` | `nix eval --impure --json` on a derivation must emit just its outPath string (TW parity); pre-fix v3 recursed into the full transitive graph (>3 min, 0 bytes for hello.drvAttrs.src). | (2026-05-20, #675) | TW + v3-direct must match |
| `run-676-apply-cu-stability.sh` | `nix eval --impure --apply <fn>` must not SIGTRAP when the apply fn returns a non-arg-derived value. Pre-fix: RootResult moved via `std::optional::emplace` left closure `cu` pointers dangling at the pre-move stack address; dispatchLoop read garbage bytecode. Fix: heap-allocate CompilationUnit via `std::unique_ptr` so its address is move-stable. | (2026-05-20, #676) | TW + v3-direct must match (9 shapes via shell driver — `.nix` fixtures can't repro since the bug needs two `runRootExpr` calls) |
| `run-677-default-print-errors.sh` | Default-mode `nix eval --impure` must catch per-attr/elem errors as `«error: <msg>»` inline (TW `ValuePrinter` parity), emit verbatim `throw` message (no "v3 throw:" prefix), emit TW's exact `abort` phrasing, short-circuit derivation print without forcing `passthru.tests`, and dedup by caller-Value-address (not stack-local) so sibling structurally-equal lists both print in full. Pre-fix: upfront `forceDeep` propagated the throw to top-level and aborted the whole print. | (2026-05-20, #677) | TW + v3-direct must match (6 shapes via shell driver) |
| `run-678-error-message-parity.sh` | Core error-message text matches TW byte-for-byte for: attribute-missing (select + getAttr), head/tail empty list, elemAt out-of-bounds (with index + size), division by zero, add-string-to-integer. Pre-fix v3 emitted v3-specific debug names (`v3 OP_ATTRS_SELECT: ...`, `v3 primop head: ...`, etc.). | (2026-05-20, #678) | TW + v3-direct must match (8 shapes via shell driver) |
| `run-679-cosmetic-parity.sh` | `builtins.unsafeGetAttrPos` returns null for synthetic sources (`--expr`/`<stdin>`/`<unknown>`), matching TW's mkPos non-SourcePath behavior. Pre-fix v3 leaked `{ file = "<string>"; ... }` to users. Plus printClosureToken helper refactor. | (2026-05-20, #679) | TW + v3-direct must match (4 shapes via shell driver) |
| `run-680-semantic-strictness.sh` | Several SEMANTIC bugs: v3 silently accepted `"x" + 1` (→ `"x1"`), `null + 1` (→ `"1"`), `"${1}"` (→ `"1"`), `true + 1` (→ `"11"`), and `builtins.length "abc"` (→ 3). TW errors on all. Plus message alignment for infinite-recursion + comparison errors. | (2026-05-20, #680) | TW + v3-direct must match (10 shapes; semantic fixes + message alignment) |
| `run-681-formals-validation.sh` | Lambda with formals called with non-attrset arg must error `expected a set but found <type>` BEFORE body runs. Pre-fix v3 silently produced the body result for ellipsis-only lambdas (`({ ... }: 1) [ ]` returned 1) because `needForce` was false. Also matches TW's exact phrasing for missing/extra-arg errors with lambda contextualName resolution (`function 'foo' called without required argument 'b'`). | (2026-05-20, #681) | TW + v3-direct must match (9 shapes: 5 type-check + 2 missing + 2 extra) |
| `run-682-tofile-context.sh` | `builtins.toFile` must (a) reject contents with derivation context (TW-matching error); (b) include path context entries as refs in the resulting store path's CA hash. Pre-fix v3 ignored contents' context entirely → wrong-hash drvPath for any toFile with path/drv interpolation. **drvPath-affecting bug** — most serious class. | (2026-05-20, #682) | TW + v3-direct must match (3 positive + 2 negative shapes) |
| `run-683-div-float-zero.sh` | Float div-by-zero must raise `division by zero` matching TW (libexpr/primops.cc:4703 unconditional). Three sub-fixes: (a) primDiv now checks all 4 numeric combos (was Int/Int only); (b) opt_const_fold no longer folds float-div-by-zero to ±inf (the "Mirror tree-walker yields ±inf" comment was wrong — TW throws); (c) hashString unknown-algo error includes the algo-list hint. | (2026-05-20, #683) | TW + v3-direct must match (8 negative + 6 positive shapes) |
| `run-684-add-error-context.sh` | `addErrorContext` must preserve the wrapped exception's runtime type so `tryEval` catches AssertionError-class errors through it. Pre-fix v3 collapsed every catch into `std::runtime_error`, breaking `tryEval (addErrorContext "ctx" (throw "x"))` semantics (returned error instead of `{success=false; value=false;}`). | (2026-05-20, #684) | TW + v3-direct must match (4 positive + 2 negative shapes) |
| `run-685-dynamic-attr-name-context.sh` | Dynamic attr names (`{ ${s} = v; }`, `attrs.${s}`, `attrs ? ${s}`) must reject string context (TW's `forceStringNoCtx`). Pre-fix v3 silently accepted contexted strings as attr names and DISCARDED the context. Three opcode sites (INIT_DYN, SELECT_DYN, HAS_DYN) all needed the check. | (2026-05-20, #685) | TW + v3-direct must match (4 negative + 5 positive shapes) |
| `run-686-with-arg-lazy.sh` | `with E; body` must evaluate `E` LAZILY (TW: thunk forced only at OP_WITH_LOOKUP). Pre-fix v3 evaluated eagerly so `with (throw "x"); 1` threw despite body never referencing the with-scope (TW returns 1). Fix: `thunkifyForArg` in lowerWith. Also aligns OP_WITH_LOOKUP error message to TW's `undefined variable 'X'`. | (2026-05-20, #686) | TW + v3-direct must match (6 positive + 3 negative shapes) |
| `run-687-integer-overflow.sh` | Integer overflow must error with TW's exact phrasing `integer overflow in {adding/subtracting/multiplying} X {+,-,*} Y`. Pre-fix v3 had two bugs: (a) OP_ADD/SUB/MUL/STR_CONCAT emitted `v3 OP_*: integer overflow` without operand values; (b) primAdd/primSub/primMul DID NOT CHECK FOR OVERFLOW at all — `builtins.add INT64_MAX 1` returned the wrapped -INT64_MIN silently. Both classes fixed. | (2026-05-20, #687) | TW + v3-direct must match (6 negative + 8 positive shapes) |
| `run-688-split-version.sh` | `builtins.splitVersion "1.0-rc1"` returned `["1","0","rc1"]` in v3 but TW returns `["1","0","rc","1"]` (splits on letter↔digit transitions per libstore/names.cc:54 `nextComponent`). Affects `compareVersions` for any version with letter+digit suffix like "rc10" vs "rc2" (was string-compare instead of numeric on the digit tail). | (2026-05-20, #688) | TW + v3-direct must match (15 positive shapes: 11 splitVersion + 4 compareVersions) |
| `run-690-module-eval.sh` | `lib.evalModules` patterns (Tier 3 finding): the deep mutual recursion in module-system fix-points needed more than 16 IR `computeFreeVars` iterations. Raised limit to 256 (lattice is monotone — convergence guaranteed; the limit is purely an infinite-loop safety net). Plus regression coverage for 6 module patterns + type-error message parity. | (2026-05-20, #690) | TW + v3-direct must match (6 positive + 1 type-error shape) |
| `run-691-value-repr.sh` | Tier 2 valueRepr helper — closes accumulated PREFIX-class error gaps in ONE shared function. Wired into coerceToString, valueLess, formals validation (3 sites), OP_LENGTH. Mirrors TW's `ValuePrinter(state, v, errorPrintOptions)` with `force=false` discipline (no recursing into the very error we're rendering). 18 shapes now match TW byte-for-byte INCLUDING the value suffix. | (2026-05-20, #691) | TW + v3-direct must EXACT-match (18 shapes) |
| `run-tier3-validation.sh` | Tier 3 broad-coverage validation: 31 shapes across batteries A/D/compositions/lib generators/lib computational/module-eval/stress. All MATCH TW byte-for-byte after the session's 15 commits (#676-#691). | (2026-05-20, Tier 3 result) | TW + v3-direct must match (31 shapes; smoke-test for any session regressions) |
| `repro-nylon-derivation-hybrid.nix` | **FIXED #694**: `lib.evalModules` + `lib.mkIf (length attrNames cfg > 0)` pattern. RCA: lower.cc isTrivialForLazy(forArg=true) eagerly evaluated `__lessThan` arg-position calls — but `>`/`<`/etc parse to `ExprCall(__lessThan, ...)`. v3 was forcing the mkIf cond at call site, tripping the `_module.freeformType` cycle that TW navigates by passing cond as a thunk. The BC-derivation-hybrid wrappers were a red herring — the bug fires whether wrappers are installed or not. | (2026-05-20, #694) | TW + v3-direct must match (now both return `{ }`) |
| `run-692-primop-error-messages.sh` | Aligned 5 more primop error messages to TW byte-for-byte: `fromTOML` "while parsing TOML"; `addDrvOutputDependencies` "context of string '<s>' must have exactly one element, but has N"; `readFile`/`readDir` "path '<p>' does not exist"; `pathExists` non-string-non-path → coerce-error mirror. Tier 1 continuation after Tier 3. | (2026-05-20, #692) | TW + v3-direct must match (8 negative + 3 positive shapes) |
| `run-693-more-primop-errors.sh` | 12 more primop error messages aligned: substring/genList negative-length, removeAttrs/attrValues/unsafeGetAttrPos/parseDrvName/scopedImport wrong-type, toPath relative+nonstring, convertHash hint, genericClosure shapes, hashFile/readFileType missing-path, toJSON-function. Introduces shared `expectedTypeButFound()` helper in primops.cc. | (2026-05-20, #693) | TW + v3-direct must match (19 error-message shapes) |
| `run-694-lessthan-thunkify.sh` | #694 fix: lower.cc isTrivialForLazy(forArg=true) drops `__lessThan` from the eager whitelist. `mkIf (length cfg > 0)` and similar patterns now thunkify cond, matching TW. Covers 8 operator-bisection variants + 6 non-cycle smoke tests (map/filter/fib + `n - 1` / `n * 2` / `n / 7`) + full nylon repro. | (2026-05-20, #694) | TW + v3-direct must match (15 shapes) |
| `run-695-getflake-bridge.sh` | #695 Path B M3: `builtins.getFlake` bridge from v3-direct to TW's libflake-registered primop. Pre-fix v3 reported `attribute 'getFlake' missing` (extraPrimOps invisible to v3's static registry). Bridge wrapper resolves both `getFlake` and `__getFlake` via `bridgeBuiltin<1>` at call time. Includes M1 (trivial IFD via toFile) regression guard. M3b heavy-getFlake eval is acceptable PARTIAL (perf, not correctness). | (2026-05-20, #695) | TW + v3-direct must agree on getFlake resolution + trivial IFD |
| `run-696-import-ifd.sh` | #696 Path B M2: real IFD support in `primImport`. When args[0] is an attrset (derivation), bridge to TW and call `nixEvalState->realisePath` which handles `DrvDeep` context by realising the build via `buildPaths`. Mirrors TW's `import` (libexpr/primops.cc:434) using v3's existing TW-state hook. Covers `runCommand` → int / string / list outputs + regression on plain toFile + nixpkgs.lib import. | (2026-05-20, #696) | TW + v3-direct must agree on IFD-driven imports (6 shapes) |
| `run-697-skip-tw-builtins-mutation.sh` | #697 perf: skip Path 1 (TW builtins.X mutation) in `installBytecodePrimop` by default. Pre-fix v3 wrappers replaced TW's `builtins.foldl'`/`filter`/`map`/etc., causing TW→v3→TW ping-pong inside callFlake (cardano-node 110s → 6.5s, 16× win). v3-side dispatch via Path 2/3 still hits wrappers. Restore via `NIX_V3_KEEP_TW_BUILTINS_MUTATION=1`. Test verifies the touched primops are still callable. | (2026-05-20, #697) | foldl'/filter/map/all/any/concatMap callable + restore-gate works |
| `run-698-callflake-compile.sh` | #698 Phase 2: v3 natively compiles + runs `call-flake.nix` (via the shared libflake source through `gen_header.process`). Diagnostic primop `builtins.__v3CompileCallFlake` triggers `CachedCallFlake::get` which does parse + lower + optimise + computeFreeVars + compile + run, expects a `Tag::Closure` result (the 3-arg lambda). Phase 3 will wire it into primGetFlake end-to-end. | (2026-05-20, #698 Phase 2) | v3 must compile call-flake.nix successfully (Tag::Closure) |
| `run-699-callflake-v3-native.sh` | #698 Phase 3: end-to-end v3-native getFlake via `NIX_V3_NATIVE_CALL_FLAKE=1` opt-in.  Trivial flake `(getFlake X).smoke` / `.a.b.c` / `.n` byte-identical to TW under both default (post-#697 bridge) and v3-native paths.  Heavy workloads (cardano-node) currently slower under v3-native (~6× TW) — separate perf track; opt-in stays opt-in until perf converges. | (2026-05-20, #698 Phase 3) | trivial-flake parity TW = v3-native (5 shapes) |

## Run all repros

The umbrella driver `test/all-v3-tests.sh` invokes the dedicated
`run-*-tests.sh` shell drivers for repro families that have them
(e.g. `run-583-tag-app-cache-tests.sh` for the #583 family,
`run-broader-thunkify-tests.sh` for #495-498, etc.).

For the standalone `.nix` fixtures listed above, the simple recipe is:

```bash
for f in src/libexpr-v3/test/repro-*.nix; do
  tw=$(build/src/nix/nix eval --impure -f "$f" 2>/dev/null)
  v3=$(NIX_V3_DIRECT_EVAL=1 \
       build/src/nix/nix eval --impure -f "$f" 2>/dev/null)
  printf "%-60s TW=%-30s v3=%s\n" "$(basename "$f")" "$tw" "$v3"
  if [[ "$tw" != "$v3" ]]; then echo "DIVERGE"; fi
done
```

(Some fixtures are TW-only or v3-only by design — see the table.  The
driver above doesn't handle those; the per-family shell scripts do.)

## Coverage gaps (TODO)

The 2026-05-17/18 session identified the following missing repros;
they're listed here as homework rather than committed empty fixtures.
Once added, they go in the table above.

- (none currently; the 5 from the session are now committed)

If you fix a bug and don't add a repro: see Rule 0 in
`src/libexpr-v3/CLAUDE.md` (every commit must answer "what hypothesis
does this kill?") and `LESSONS_LEARNED_2026-05-15.md` §4.8 (bisect-to-
fixture workflow).
