# v3 cache-coherence lint: enforce two operating rules codified after
# the #803 / #814 / #815 cache-coherence arc (see lode/
# NEXT_STEPS_2026-05-25.md §2.6 + §A4).
#
# Rule 1: schema bump on LambdaDescriptor field add/remove/rename.
#   Any commit that adds, removes, or reorders fields in
#   `LambdaDescriptor` (declared in `include/v3/closure.hh` and serialised
#   in `serialize.cc`) MUST also bump `kSchemaVersion` in
#   `include/v3/serialize.hh`.  Without the bump, older on-disk CUs
#   load under the new layout and produce garbage values for the
#   shifted fields — exactly the failure mode of #814 (selectorSym
#   silently consumed the wrong byte stream).
#
# Rule 2: schema bump on deserialise-path interpretation change.
#   Any change to `serialize.cc`'s deserialiseCU body that alters how
#   existing bytes are interpreted (e.g., new remap, new re-sort, new
#   conditional read) MUST also bump `kSchemaVersion`.  Pure refactors
#   that touch deserialiseCU but don't change behaviour are exempt and
#   must be flagged via the `# CACHE-COHERENCE-EXEMPT: <reason>` marker
#   in the commit message body.
#
# How the lint detects violations:
#   - Inspect the diff (staged for pre-commit, or HEAD..main for CI).
#   - If `closure.hh`'s `struct LambdaDescriptor` body has any added /
#     removed line (modulo whitespace, comments) → Rule 1 applies.
#   - If `serialize.cc`'s `deserializeCU` body has any added line
#     (modulo whitespace, comments) → Rule 2 applies.
#   - In either case, `include/v3/serialize.hh`'s `kSchemaVersion`
#     constant MUST also be modified in the same diff (an integer
#     increment is verified textually, not numerically).
#   - Either a matching schema-bump line OR a `CACHE-COHERENCE-EXEMPT`
#     marker (in the diff body) passes.
#
# Falsification check (per [[falsification-rule]]):
#   - To verify the lint catches the #814 historical pattern: replay
#     `git diff $(git merge-base 9e09a7e4c~1 master) 9e09a7e4c~1` (the
#     pre-#814 state where selectorSym was added without bump) — lint
#     must reject.  Then replay 9e09a7e4c (the fix commit that bumps
#     schema 12→13) — lint must accept.
#   - To verify lint doesn't fire on pure refactors: a no-op
#     whitespace-only diff in serialize.cc must NOT trigger Rule 2.
#
# Usage:
#   bash src/libexpr-v3/test/lint-cache-coherence.sh             # pre-commit (staged)
#   CACHE_LINT_RANGE=HEAD..origin/master \
#     bash src/libexpr-v3/test/lint-cache-coherence.sh           # CI range
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  no violation
#   1  one or both rules violated
#   2  lint preflight failed (file missing, git not available, ...)

# Rule 3: every codegen-affecting env gate is in the disk-cache
#         fingerprint (kGates[])
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The CU disk-cache key keys only on (path, content, schema); the
# `codegenGateFingerprint()` in primops.cc mixes the *values* of a
# canonical list of env gates (kGates[]) into the key so that a CU
# compiled under e.g. NIX_V3_RAW_FORMALS=1 is namespaced away from a
# default-codegen CU.  DEFECT_REVIEW_2026-07-03 §1.4 found that this
# list had silently drifted out of sync with the actual getenv() reads
# in the codegen files (NIX_V3_RAW_FORMALS + NIX_V3_NO_NONREC_ATTRS_INIT
# both emit different opcodes but were absent from kGates), and that the
# comment claiming `lint-cache-coherence.sh` enforced the sync was
# fictional — the lint only checked Rules 1/2.  This rule closes that:
# every `getenv("NIX_V3_*")` in a codegen file MUST be either in
# kGates[] OR in the explicit non-codegen allowlist below.  A CU whose
# bytecode depends on a gate not in kGates would be loaded under the
# wrong key on any warm run after a toggled run — the exact silent
# wrong-codegen failure the fingerprint exists to prevent.
#
# This is a FULL-TREE invariant (not diff-scoped): it re-verifies the
# whole codegen surface on every run, so a hole cannot slip through a
# commit that doesn't touch primops.cc.
#
# Paths are overridable (CACHE_LINT_PRIMOPS / CACHE_LINT_CODEGEN_DIR)
# so the self-test (run-cache-gate-coverage-tests.sh) can drive it with
# synthetic fixtures.  CACHE_LINT_RULE3_ONLY=1 runs ONLY this rule
# (skipping the git/diff-based Rules 1/2), for the self-test.
