# Beta-reduce positive-impact guard.
#
# A pattern that the pass SHOULD inline: many single-use single-arg
# lambdas in a let-binding chain.  When inlined, each lambda body's
# arithmetic folds into a single sequence of binary ops; the
# constant-fold pass (run twice in the pipeline post-beta-reduce)
# collapses the literal arithmetic into a single LitInt.
#
# In effect: this should evaluate to a LitInt at compile time, with
# no runtime computation at all.  Comparing v3 (with beta-reduce)
# vs v3 (NIX_V3_NO_BETA_REDUCE=1) should show:
#   - beta-reduce ON:  ~0 thunk allocations beyond startup overhead
#   - beta-reduce OFF: many closure/thunk allocations
#
# A future bench-harness test could compare NIX_VM_STATS allocs
# under both modes; this fixture is the input.
#
# Run:
#   nix eval --impure -f repro-beta-reduce-perf.nix
#   NIX_V3_DIRECT_EVAL=1 \
#     nix eval --impure -f repro-beta-reduce-perf.nix
#
# Expected output (both TW and v3, with or without gate):
#   45
