# Regression: IR Phase A beta-reduction must preserve semantics.
#
# Positive test: a battery of patterns that the pass IS supposed to
# inline (same-block, single-arg, no formals, simple body) and a few
# patterns it MUST NOT touch (multi-use, formals, nested closures).
# All must produce the same value vs TW and with the pass disabled
# (NIX_V3_NO_BETA_REDUCE=1).
#
# Run (parity):
#   NIX_V3_DIRECT_EVAL=1 nix eval --impure -f repro-beta-reduce.nix
#   nix eval --impure -f repro-beta-reduce.nix
#
# Run (gate-off):
#   NIX_V3_NO_BETA_REDUCE=1 NIX_V3_DIRECT_EVAL=1 \
#     nix eval --impure -f repro-beta-reduce.nix
#
# Expected output (all three):
#   { aa = 6; bb = 30; cc = 60; dd = 100; ee = 31; ff = 42; gg = 6; hh = 21; }
