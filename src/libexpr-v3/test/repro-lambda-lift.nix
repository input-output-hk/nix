# Phase D — closure-free lambda lifting regression fixture.
#
# Asserts: TW and v3-direct (with Phase D ON and OFF) produce the
# same result for a variety of capture-free + capturing lambda
# shapes.
#
# Lesson: IR_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN_2026-05-18.md Phase D — when a
# Lambda IR node has empty freeVars AND empty lexicalWiths, every
# OP_MAKE_CLOSURE produces a semantically identical Closure (same
# desc, no upvalues, no captured withs).  Intern by descriptor in
# vm.cc OP_MAKE_CLOSURE; gate NIX_V3_NO_LAMBDA_LIFT=1.
#
# Coverage:
#   1. Plain capture-free lambda: f = x: x + 1.
#   2. Capturing lambda (must NOT be interned): mkAdder = n: (x: x + n).
#   3. Capture-free lambda inside `with`: shouldn't intern the inner
#      lambda if it references an enclosing with — but our outer
#      `(a: ...)` here doesn't reference X, so it's still safe.
#   4. Higher-order: a factory returning a capture-free lambda.
#   5. Nested currying: outer is capture-free, inner captures the
#      outer's arg.
#   6. Recursive lambda via let-rec: f references itself, NOT
#      capture-free (free var f).  Should fall through to the
#      generic path.
